Question #: 1
A company runs a web application with a predictable, steady-state workload that must be available 24/7. The application runs on a specific family of EC2 instances (m5). To achieve the highest possible discount for this workload, which EC2 purchasing option should be chosen?

A. On-Demand Instances
B. Spot Instances
C. Standard Reserved Instances
D. Convertible Reserved Instances

Answer: C

Explanation: Standard Reserved Instances offer the highest discount (up to 72%) in exchange for a commitment to a specific instance family, size, and region for a 1 or 3-year term. Since the workload is predictable and uses a specific instance family, this provides the best cost savings. On-Demand (A) is flexible but most expensive. Spot (B) is for interruptible workloads. Convertible RIs (D) offer a lower discount in exchange for flexibility to change instance families.

Question #: 2
A company needs to store customer data for 7 years to meet compliance requirements. The data is rarely, if ever, accessed after the first 90 days, but if access is needed, it must be available within 12 hours. What is the MOST cost-effective S3 storage class for this long-term archival?

A. S3 Standard
B. S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA)
C. S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval
D. S3 Glacier Deep Archive

Answer: C

Explanation: S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval is designed for archival data where retrieval times of a few hours are acceptable. It offers a very low storage cost. S3 Glacier Deep Archive (D) is even cheaper but has a default retrieval time of 12 hours, which meets the requirement, however, Flexible Retrieval also offers expedited retrievals in minutes, making it more flexible. Given the requirement is *within* 12 hours, Flexible Retrieval is a safe and cost-effective choice. S3 Standard (A) and IA (B) are too expensive for 7-year archival.

Question #: 3
A data analytics company runs large-scale batch processing jobs every night. These jobs are fault-tolerant and can be stopped and restarted without losing data. The primary goal is to minimize the cost of the EC2 compute for these jobs. Which purchasing option is the most suitable?

A. On-Demand Instances
B. Spot Instances
C. EC2 Instance Savings Plans
D. Dedicated Hosts

Answer: B

Explanation: Spot Instances are the most cost-effective option for workloads that are fault-tolerant and can handle interruptions. Since the batch jobs can be restarted, they are a perfect fit for leveraging AWS's spare compute capacity at discounts of up to 90% off the On-Demand price.

---

Question #: 4
A company stores user-uploaded images in an S3 bucket. They are unsure about the access patterns; some images are very popular for a few weeks and then rarely accessed, while others have unpredictable access patterns. They want to automatically optimize storage costs without affecting performance. Which S3 storage class should they use for these images?

A. S3 Standard
B. S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA)
C. S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval
D. S3 Intelligent-Tiering

Answer: D

Explanation: S3 Intelligent-Tiering is the purpose-built solution for data with unknown, changing, or unpredictable access patterns. It automatically moves objects between a frequent access tier and an infrequent access tier (and optional archive tiers) based on actual access patterns, optimizing costs without any performance impact or operational overhead.

---

Question #: 5
A company has a steady-state workload and commits to a 3-year term for an "EC2 Instance Savings Plan". What is a key benefit of this plan compared to a Standard Reserved Instance?

A. It provides a higher discount than a Standard RI.
B. It provides the flexibility to change the instance family (e.g., from m5 to c5) and region while still receiving a discount.
C. It can be applied to AWS Fargate and Lambda usage.
D. It only applies to a specific Availability Zone.

Answer: B

Explanation: The key benefit of an EC2 Instance Savings Plan over a Standard RI is flexibility. While both offer similar discounts, the Savings Plan commits you to a specific instance family in a specific region (e.g., m5 in us-east-1), but you are free to change the instance size (e.g., from m5.large to m5.xlarge) or even operating system and still receive the discount. A Standard RI locks you into a specific size as well. Note: A *Compute* Savings Plan provides even more flexibility, including changing region and family.

---

Question #: 6
You are configuring an S3 Lifecycle policy for a bucket containing log files. The policy has two rules:
1. Transition objects to S3 Standard-IA after 30 days.
2. Expire (delete) objects after 365 days.
An object is uploaded on January 1st. What is its status on February 15th of the same year?

A. It is still in S3 Standard.
B. It has been transitioned to S3 Standard-IA.
C. It has been deleted.
D. It has been moved to S3 Glacier.

Answer: B

Explanation: On January 1st, the object is uploaded to S3 Standard. The first lifecycle rule is to transition after 30 days. On January 31st (30 days later), the object becomes eligible and is transitioned to S3 Standard-IA. Therefore, on February 15th, the object resides in the S3 Standard-IA storage class.

---

Question #: 7
A company has a baseline compute usage of approximately $10/hour across various instance families and regions. This usage is consistent and will remain for at least one year. They want a purchasing option that provides the most flexibility to adapt to new instance types and regions in the future. Which option is BEST?

A. Standard Reserved Instances
B. Convertible Reserved Instances
C. Compute Savings Plan
D. EC2 Instance Savings Plan

Answer: C

Explanation: A Compute Savings Plan offers the highest degree of flexibility. You commit to a certain amount of spend (e.g., $10/hour) for a term, and in return, you receive a discount. This discount automatically applies to your usage regardless of instance family, size, OS, tenancy, or AWS Region. It also applies to Fargate and Lambda usage. This is more flexible than RIs or an EC2 Instance Savings Plan.

---

Question #: 8
A company stores critical, frequently accessed data in an S3 bucket. They cannot tolerate any data loss, even from the failure of an entire Availability Zone. Which storage class should be used?

A. S3 Standard
B. S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA)
C. S3 Glacier Deep Archive
D. An EBS volume

Answer: A

Explanation: S3 Standard is designed for high durability and availability for frequently accessed data. It achieves this by storing data redundantly across a minimum of three Availability Zones. This design means it can withstand the loss of an entire AZ without any data loss or disruption of availability. S3 One Zone-IA (B) is not resilient to an AZ failure as it stores data in only one AZ.

---

Question #: 9
For which of the following workloads would an On-Demand EC2 instance be the most cost-effective choice?

A. A stateful, 24/7 database server with a predictable load.
B. A short-term, spiky workload for a new application being developed and tested, where the usage pattern is unknown.
C. A fault-tolerant, nightly batch processing job.
D. A web server with a consistent traffic pattern that will run for at least 3 years.

Answer: B

Explanation: On-Demand instances are ideal for workloads where you cannot predict the usage pattern, that are short-term, or that cannot be interrupted. The pay-by-the-second model provides maximum flexibility without any long-term commitment, which is perfect for development and testing environments. The other options are better suited for RIs/Savings Plans (A, D) or Spot Instances (C).

---

Question #: 10
An S3 Lifecycle policy is configured to transition objects to S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval. What is the minimum number of days an object must be stored in its current class before it can be transitioned?

A. 0 days. Objects can be transitioned immediately.
B. 30 days for S3 Standard and S3 Standard-IA.
C. 90 days for S3 Standard and S3 Standard-IA.
D. 180 days for S3 Standard and S3 Standard-IA.

Answer: B

Explanation: S3 has minimum storage duration requirements for certain transitions to prevent misuse of the pricing tiers. For transitions from S3 Standard or S3 Standard-IA to any of the Glacier classes or Intelligent-Tiering's archive tiers, the object must be stored for at least 30 days in its current class.

---

Question #: 11
A company has purchased a 1-year, All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance. What does "All Upfront" mean?

A. They pay for the entire 1-year term in a single payment at the beginning, receiving the highest possible discount for that RI type.
B. They pay nothing upfront but are billed a discounted hourly rate.
C. They pay a portion of the cost upfront and the rest in monthly installments.
D. They are billed based on the number of instances they reserve.

Answer: A

Explanation: Reserved Instances have three payment options. "All Upfront" provides the largest discount because you pay the full cost of the entire reservation term (1 or 3 years) in one payment at the start. "Partial Upfront" involves a smaller upfront payment and then discounted monthly bills. "No Upfront" has the lowest discount and involves only discounted monthly bills.

---

Question #: 12
A company stores medical images that are accessed frequently for the first 30 days by doctors. After 30 days, they are accessed on average once a month for the next year. After one year, they are rarely accessed but must be kept for 7 years. What is the MOST cost-effective lifecycle configuration?

A. S3 Standard for 30 days, then transition to S3 Standard-IA, then expire after 7 years.
B. S3 Standard for 30 days, then transition to S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval, then expire after 7 years.
C. S3 Standard for 30 days, then transition to S3 Standard-IA, then transition to S3 Glacier Deep Archive after 365 days, then expire after 7 years.
D. Use S3 Intelligent-Tiering for the entire 7-year period.

Answer: C

Explanation: This configuration perfectly matches the access patterns. S3 Standard is for the initial 30 days of frequent access. S3 Standard-IA is cost-effective for the next year of infrequent but rapid-access needs. S3 Glacier Deep Archive is the absolute cheapest option for the final 6 years of long-term archival where slow retrieval is acceptable. Expiring the objects after 7 years meets the final requirement.

---

Question #: 13
Which EC2 purchasing option provides a capacity reservation in a specific Availability Zone?

A. On-Demand Instances
B. Spot Instances
C. Zonal Reserved Instances
D. A Compute Savings Plan

Answer: C

Explanation: A key feature of Reserved Instances is that they can provide a capacity reservation. A Zonal RI reserves capacity for a specific instance type in a specific Availability Zone. This guarantees that you will be able to launch an instance with those attributes when you need it. Regional RIs and Savings Plans provide a discount but do not reserve capacity.

---

Question #: 14
An object is stored in the S3 One Zone-IA storage class. What is a key risk associated with this storage class compared to S3 Standard-IA?

A. It has a lower durability guarantee.
B. It has higher latency for data retrieval.
C. The data will be lost if the single Availability Zone where it is stored fails.
D. There is a high cost for retrieving the data.

Answer: C

Explanation: The "One Zone" in the name is the key. Unlike other S3 storage classes that store data across at least three AZs, S3 One Zone-IA stores data in a single Availability Zone. This makes it cheaper, but it also means that if that specific AZ is destroyed or becomes unavailable, the data will be lost. It is only suitable for data that is recreatable.

---

Question #: 15
A company has a workload that runs on a fleet of c5.large instances for a consistent 40 hours per week (e.g., during business hours). Which purchasing option would provide a discount for this specific usage pattern?

A. This is not possible; you must commit to 24/7 usage for a discount.
B. A scheduled Reserved Instance.
C. A Spot Block reservation.
D. A Compute Savings Plan.

Answer: B

Explanation: Scheduled Reserved Instances are a specific purchasing option that allows you to reserve capacity for a recurring, predictable time window (daily, weekly, or monthly). This is a perfect fit for a workload that only runs during specific hours, as you only pay for the time you have reserved.

---

Question #: 16
What is the primary purpose of an S3 Lifecycle policy?

A. To automatically replicate objects to another region.
B. To manage access control for objects in a bucket.
C. To automate the transition of objects to different storage classes or to expire them to manage costs.
D. To track the version history of objects.

Answer: C

Explanation: A lifecycle policy is a cost optimization tool. It allows you to define rules that automatically move your objects through the different S3 storage classes (e.g., from Standard to IA to Glacier) as they age and are accessed less frequently. You can also create rules to permanently delete old objects.

---

Question #: 17
A company has purchased a Compute Savings Plan. They are currently running a mix of m5.large instances in us-east-1 and c5.large instances in eu-west-1. They decide to shut down the c5 instances and launch some AWS Fargate tasks instead. How will the Savings Plan apply?

A. It will no longer apply as the instance family and region have changed.
B. It will continue to apply to the m5.large instances, and the unused portion of the commitment will also automatically apply to the AWS Fargate usage.
C. It will only apply to the m5.large instances; the Fargate usage will be billed at On-Demand rates.
D. The Savings Plan will be automatically cancelled.

Answer: B

Explanation: This demonstrates the flexibility of a Compute Savings Plan. The discount applies automatically to any compute usage across instance families, regions, and compute services like Fargate and Lambda. The system will always apply the discount to the usage in the most optimal way to maximize your savings.

---

Question #: 18
You need to store a 10 TB dataset for a year. The data will be accessed once per quarter for a reporting job that can take up to 8 hours to run. Which storage solution offers the lowest cost for storing this data?

A. An EBS st1 volume
B. S3 Standard-IA
C. S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval
D. S3 Glacier Deep Archive

Answer: D

Explanation: For data that is accessed very rarely (once a quarter) and where a long retrieval time (up to 12 hours for standard retrieval) is acceptable, S3 Glacier Deep Archive provides the lowest possible storage cost on AWS. This makes it ideal for long-term archival where immediate access is not a requirement.

---

Question #: 19
When is it most cost-effective to use an On-Demand EC2 instance?

A. For a predictable, 24/7 workload that will run for 3 years.
B. For a fault-tolerant batch processing job that can be interrupted.
C. For a new application with an unknown, spiky traffic pattern.
D. For a database that requires a capacity reservation.

Answer: C

Explanation: The flexibility of On-Demand pricing (paying by the second with no commitment) is perfect for workloads that are unpredictable, spiky, or short-term. It allows you to handle traffic bursts without being locked into a long-term plan, making it ideal for new applications where the usage pattern has not yet been established.

---

Question #: 20
A lifecycle rule is configured to expire objects 180 days after creation. The bucket also has versioning enabled. What happens when the rule runs on an object that is 200 days old?

A. The object and all its previous versions are permanently deleted.
B. The current version of the object is permanently deleted.
C. S3 adds a delete marker to the object, but the previous versions are retained.
D. The rule fails because the object has multiple versions.

Answer: C

Explanation: When you set an expiration action on a versioned bucket, it does not permanently delete the current version of the object. Instead, to preserve the object's history, S3 adds a delete marker, which becomes the new "current" version. The previous versions are unaffected. To delete old versions, you must create a separate lifecycle rule specifically for noncurrent versions.

---

Question #: 21
Which of the following is a key difference between a Standard Reserved Instance and a Convertible Reserved Instance?

A. Standard RIs can be sold on the RI Marketplace, while Convertible RIs cannot.
B. Standard RIs provide a capacity reservation, while Convertible RIs do not.
C. Standard RIs are locked to a specific instance family, while Convertible RIs can be exchanged for another RI of a different family.
D. Standard RIs have a 3-year term, while Convertible RIs have a 1-year term.

Answer: C

Explanation: The key feature of a Convertible RI is its flexibility. During the term, you can exchange your Convertible RI for another one with different attributes, such as a different instance family, size, or operating system, as long as the new RI is of equal or greater value. Standard RIs are locked into their original instance family and size. This flexibility comes with a slightly lower discount compared to Standard RIs.

---

Question #: 22
Data is stored in S3 Intelligent-Tiering. After 180 days of no access, you want the data to be moved to the cheapest possible archival storage. What must be configured?

A. This happens automatically with Intelligent-Tiering.
B. You must configure a separate S3 Lifecycle policy for this transition.
C. You must opt-in to the deep archive access tier within the S3 Intelligent-Tiering configuration.
D. You must manually move the data using the S3 console.

Answer: C

Explanation: The S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class has optional, opt-in "Archive Access" and "Deep Archive Access" tiers. By default, it only moves data between the Frequent and Infrequent access tiers. To have it automatically move data to an even cheaper archive tier after a longer period (e.g., 90, 180 days), you must explicitly enable and configure these archive tiers in the storage class settings.

---

Question #: 23
A company has a large fleet of EC2 instances running various workloads across multiple regions. The overall usage is very stable. They want to get a discount on their compute spend while maintaining the flexibility to change instance types and regions as their applications evolve. Which is the best purchasing option?

A. Purchase Standard RIs for each specific instance type in each region.
B. Purchase a Compute Savings Plan with a 3-year term.
C. Use Spot Instances for the entire fleet.
D. Use On-Demand instances and rely on Auto Scaling to manage costs.

Answer: B

Explanation: A Compute Savings Plan is the perfect fit for this scenario. It provides a significant discount in exchange for a commitment to a consistent amount of compute usage (in $/hour). The key benefit is its flexibility: the discount automatically applies to any EC2 instance usage, anywhere in the world, regardless of family or region. It also applies to Fargate and Lambda, making it ideal for a diverse and evolving environment.

---

Question #: 24
What happens when you request to retrieve an object that is stored in S3 Glacier Deep Archive?

A. The object is available for download instantly.
B. The retrieval process must be initiated first, and the data is typically available within 12 hours.
C. The object is moved to S3 Standard and can then be downloaded.
D. You must contact AWS Support to retrieve the object.

Answer: B

Explanation: Data in archival storage classes like Glacier Deep Archive is not instantly accessible. You must first initiate a restore request. For S3 Glacier Deep Archive, the standard retrieval time is within 12 hours. Once the restore is complete, a temporary copy of the object is made available in S3 for you to download.

---

Question #: 25
Which two factors are considered when AWS applies a Savings Plan discount to your usage? (Choose TWO)

A. The AWS Region of the resource.
B. The tag applied to the resource.
C. The type of Savings Plan (Compute or EC2 Instance).
D. The committed hourly spend of the plan.
E. The number of security groups attached.

Answer: C, D

Explanation: The Savings Plan calculation is based on your commitment and the plan type. You commit to a certain amount of hourly spend (e.g., $5/hour) (D). The type of plan (C) determines the flexibility. A Compute Savings Plan applies that commitment to almost any compute usage, while an EC2 Instance Savings Plan applies it only to a specific instance family in a specific region. The system then automatically finds the best application of your committed spend to maximize your discount.

---

Question #: 26
A bucket has a lifecycle policy to transition noncurrent object versions to S3 Glacier Deep Archive after 60 days. The bucket has versioning enabled. An object is created, then updated 10 days later, and then updated again 20 days after that. When does the first noncurrent version become eligible for transition?

A. 60 days after the object was first created.
B. 60 days after the second version was created.
C. 70 days after the object was first created.
D. 90 days after the object was first created.

Answer: C

Explanation: The lifecycle policy for noncurrent versions is based on the age of the version itself. The first version becomes noncurrent on day 10 when the second version is uploaded. The 60-day timer for this noncurrent version starts on day 10. Therefore, it becomes eligible for transition 60 days after day 10, which is on day 70.

---

Question #: 27
A company wants to run a critical database on a physical server that is not shared with any other customer. They also need to bring their own per-socket software licenses to AWS. Which EC2 purchasing option meets these requirements?

A. Dedicated Instances
B. Dedicated Hosts
C. Reserved Instances
D. On-Demand Capacity Reservations

Answer: B

Explanation: A Dedicated Host provides a physical server dedicated entirely to your use. This is crucial for "Bring Your Own License" (BYOL) scenarios where software licenses are tied to physical attributes like sockets or cores. It gives you visibility into the physical server and control over instance placement, which is not available with Dedicated Instances.

---

Question #: 28
Which S3 storage class is designed for data that is accessed less than once a month but requires millisecond retrieval times when it is accessed?

A. S3 Standard
B. S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA)
C. S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval
D. S3 Glacier Deep Archive

Answer: B

Explanation: S3 Standard-IA is the perfect fit. It offers a lower storage price than S3 Standard in exchange for a per-GB data retrieval fee. Critically, it provides the same high-throughput, low-latency performance as S3 Standard, so when you do need to access the data, it's available instantly.

---

Question #: 29
A company has a very large, fault-tolerant rendering workload that can be run at any time of day. They want to use Spot Instances. To minimize the chance of their instances being interrupted, what is a good strategy?

A. Use only one specific, popular instance type.
B. Run the workload only during peak business hours.
C. Configure the Spot Fleet or Auto Scaling group to be flexible across multiple instance types and multiple Availability Zones.
D. Set the maximum Spot price to be equal to the On-Demand price.

Answer: C

Explanation: A key strategy for using Spot effectively is flexibility. By configuring your request to be able to use a variety of different instance types (e.g., m5.large, m4.large, c5.large) and to launch in any of the AZs in a region, you are tapping into a much larger pool of spare capacity. This significantly reduces the likelihood that a price spike in one specific Spot pool will cause your instances to be interrupted.

---

Question #: 30
An S3 lifecycle configuration has a rule to expire objects. What is the smallest unit of time you can specify for this rule?

A. 1 hour
B. 12 hours
C. 1 day
D. 30 days

Answer: C

Explanation: S3 lifecycle rules for transitions and expirations operate on a daily basis. The smallest time period you can specify in a rule is one day. The actions are not performed in real-time but are part of an asynchronous daily process.

---

Question #: 31
What is a key difference between a Savings Plan and a Reserved Instance?

A. Savings Plans require a 3-year commitment, while RIs can be 1 year.
B. Savings Plans are applied automatically to usage across instance families and regions (for Compute plans), while RIs are less flexible.
C. RIs offer a higher discount than Savings Plans for the same commitment.
D. Savings Plans provide a capacity reservation, while RIs do not.

Answer: B

Explanation: The primary benefit and difference of Savings Plans is their flexibility. After you make a commitment, the savings are applied automatically to your compute usage without you needing to perform any manual exchanges or modifications. A Compute Savings Plan automatically adapts as you change instance families, sizes, or even regions. RIs, especially Standard RIs, require you to match the usage to the specific reservation to get the benefit.

---

Question #: 32
A medical archive stores X-ray images. The images must be retrievable within 5 minutes for emergency consultations. The images are, on average, accessed only once a year. What is the MOST cost-effective S3 storage class?

A. S3 Standard-IA
B. S3 One Zone-IA
C. S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval
D. S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval

Answer: C

Explanation: S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval is designed for this "long-term storage with instant access" use case. It offers the same millisecond, synchronous retrieval performance as S3 Standard, but with a much lower storage cost. This makes it ideal for archives where you need immediate access when a request comes in. Standard-IA (A) would also work but is slightly more expensive to store. Flexible Retrieval (D) is too slow.

---

Question #: 33
A company wants to reserve compute capacity for a one-time event that will last for 4 hours next Saturday. They need a guarantee that the capacity will be available. Which purchasing option allows for this?

A. Spot Block
B. A short-term Reserved Instance
C. An On-Demand Capacity Reservation
D. A Scheduled Reserved Instance

Answer: C

Explanation: An On-Demand Capacity Reservation allows you to reserve a specific amount of EC2 capacity in a specific AZ for any duration, without a 1-year or 3-year commitment. You pay the equivalent of On-Demand rates for the capacity while it is reserved, but it gives you the peace of mind that the capacity is guaranteed to be there when you need to launch your instances.

---

Question #: 34
An S3 bucket has versioning enabled. A lifecycle policy is configured to "Expire current object versions" after 365 days. What does this action do?

A. It permanently deletes the object and all its versions.
B. It adds a delete marker to the object.
C. It transitions the object to S3 Glacier Deep Archive.
D. It deletes any noncurrent versions of the object.

Answer: B

Explanation: For a versioned object, the "Expire current version" action does not actually delete the data. It adds a delete marker, which becomes the new current version of the object, making it appear as if it was deleted. The previous data versions are preserved as noncurrent versions.

---

Question #: 35
A company has a very stable application running on `m5.xlarge` instances 24/7. They will be using this setup for at least the next 3 years. They want the absolute lowest possible cost. What is their best option?

A. A 3-year, All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance.
B. A 3-year, No Upfront, Compute Savings Plan.
C. A 1-year, Partial Upfront, Convertible Reserved Instance.
D. Spot Instances.

Answer: A

Explanation: To get the maximum possible discount, you need to provide the highest level of commitment. A 3-year term offers a higher discount than a 1-year term. An All Upfront payment offers a higher discount than Partial or No Upfront. A Standard RI offers a higher discount than a Convertible RI or a Savings Plan because it is the least flexible. Combining all of these (3-year, All Upfront, Standard RI) will yield the lowest hourly rate for that specific instance.

---

Question #: 36
Which S3 storage class is physically stored in only one Availability Zone?

A. S3 Standard
B. S3 Standard-IA
C. S3 Intelligent-Tiering
D. S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: D

Explanation: As its name implies, S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access stores data in a single AZ. This lack of multi-AZ resilience is what makes it about 20% cheaper than the architecturally similar S3 Standard-IA class. It's suitable for infrequently accessed data that can be easily recreated if the AZ fails.

---

Question #: 37
You have purchased an EC2 Instance Savings Plan for the `c5` family in the `eu-west-1` region. Which of the following usage will be covered by the plan?

A. A c5.large instance running in us-east-1.
B. A t3.micro instance running in eu-west-1.
C. A c5.2xlarge instance running in eu-west-1.
D. An m5.large instance running in eu-west-1.

Answer: C

Explanation: An EC2 Instance Savings Plan provides a discount for a specific instance family in a specific region. It provides the flexibility to change the instance size (e.g., from `.large` to `.2xlarge`), OS, or tenancy within that family and region. It would not cover a different region (A), a different instance family (B, D).

---

Question #: 38
A company wants to archive 500 TB of data. They estimate they will need to retrieve about 5% of this data per month. Retrieval requests are urgent and must be completed in 1-5 minutes. Which storage class provides this retrieval speed at the lowest storage cost?

A. S3 Standard-IA
B. S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval
C. S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval with Expedited retrieval
D. S3 Glacier Deep Archive with Bulk retrieval

Answer: C

Explanation: S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval offers several retrieval options. Its "Expedited" retrieval option is designed for urgent requests and can typically return data in 1-5 minutes. While Glacier Instant Retrieval (B) is also fast, Glacier Flexible Retrieval has a lower per-GB storage cost, which would be more significant for a 500 TB archive. This makes it the best balance of low storage cost and fast retrieval capability for this use case.

---

Question #: 39
When is it a good idea to use a Convertible Reserved Instance instead of a Standard Reserved Instance?

A. When you need the absolute highest possible discount.
B. When your workload is intermittent and can be interrupted.
C. When you have a steady-state workload but you anticipate that you might need to change to a different instance family in the future.
D. When you need to reserve capacity in a specific Availability Zone.

Answer: C

Explanation: The primary benefit of a Convertible RI is flexibility. If you are not certain that you will stick with the same instance family for the entire 1 or 3-year term, a Convertible RI is a safer choice. It allows you to exchange your reservation for one covering a different instance family, OS, or tenancy, adapting to your changing needs. This flexibility comes at the cost of a slightly lower discount than a Standard RI.

---

Question #: 40
A lifecycle policy is configured on a versioned bucket to transition noncurrent versions to S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval after 30 days and then permanently delete them after 365 days. An object is uploaded on day 1 and then overwritten with a new version on day 10. When is the original version permanently deleted?

A. On day 365
B. On day 375
C. On day 40
D. It is never deleted.

Answer: B

Explanation: The original version becomes noncurrent on day 10. The 365-day expiration timer for this noncurrent version starts on day 10. Therefore, it will be permanently deleted 365 days after day 10, which is day 375 (10 + 365).

---

Question #: 41
Which of the following EC2 instance types can be covered by a Savings Plan?

A. On-Demand
B. Spot Instances
C. Reserved Instances
D. Both A and C

Answer: A

Explanation: Savings Plans are a pricing model that gives you a discount on your On-Demand instance usage. You commit to a certain amount of spend, and any On-Demand usage up to that commitment is charged at the lower Savings Plan rate. They do not apply to Spot or Reserved Instances (which are already discounted).

---

Question #: 42
An object in an S3 bucket is 50 days old. A lifecycle rule is configured to transition objects to S3 Standard-IA after 30 days. There is a separate fee associated with this lifecycle transition. What is this fee for?

A. The S3 API PUT request that performs the transition.
B. The cost of storing the object for the first 30 days.
C. An early deletion fee.
D. A fee for data transfer out of S3.

Answer: A

Explanation: A lifecycle transition is an automated action, but it is still fundamentally a request made on your behalf to move the object. S3 charges a small, per-object fee for the PUT/COPY requests that are used to move objects between storage classes. For a bucket with millions of small objects, these transition costs can be a factor in your overall cost optimization strategy.

Question #: 43
Which pricing model requires a 1- or 3-year commitment in exchange for a discount on a specific instance configuration (e.g., m5.large in us-east-1a)?

A. Spot Instances
B. On-Demand
C. Zonal Reserved Instances
D. Compute Savings Plan

Answer: C

Explanation: A Zonal Reserved Instance is the most specific type of commitment. It provides both a discount and a capacity reservation for a particular instance type and size in a specific Availability Zone for a 1 or 3-year term.

---

Question #: 44
A company wants to store data with changing access patterns in the most cost-effective way. They have enabled S3 Intelligent-Tiering and have also enabled the optional Deep Archive Access tier after 180 days. An object is not accessed for 200 days. Where will the object be stored?

A. S3 Standard
B. S3 Infrequent Access tier
C. S3 Archive Access tier
D. S3 Deep Archive Access tier

Answer: D

Explanation: S3 Intelligent-Tiering automatically moves the object from the Frequent Access tier to the Infrequent Access tier after 30 days of no access. Since the optional Deep Archive tier is enabled for after 180 days of no access, the object will be moved there. On day 200, it would reside in the Deep Archive Access tier.

---

Question #: 45
What is the primary benefit of a "No Upfront" Reserved Instance payment option?

A. It provides the highest possible discount.
B. It allows you to get a discounted hourly rate without any initial capital expenditure.
C. It allows you to pay for the entire reservation at the end of the term.
D. It does not require a time commitment.

Answer: B

Explanation: The "No Upfront" option is ideal for companies that want to take advantage of the discounted RI rates but do not want to or cannot make a large upfront payment. You still make a 1 or 3-year commitment, but your entire cost is paid via a discounted hourly bill each month.

---

Question #: 46
A company has a legal requirement to store financial records for 10 years. The data is almost never accessed. If a regulatory body requests a record, the company has up to 48 hours to provide it. What is the most cost-optimized storage solution?

A. An EBS Throughput Optimized HDD (st1) volume.
B. S3 Standard-IA storage.
C. S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval.
D. S3 Glacier Deep Archive.

Answer: D

Explanation: This is a perfect use case for S3 Glacier Deep Archive. It is the lowest-cost storage option in AWS. Its standard retrieval time is 12 hours, and bulk retrieval can take longer, but both are well within the 48-hour requirement. The extremely low storage cost makes it ideal for this kind of long-term, "write-once, read-never" archival.

---

Question #: 47
Which two of the following are characteristics of Spot Instances? (Choose TWO)

A. They offer the largest discounts on EC2 compute capacity.
B. They provide a capacity reservation.
C. They can be interrupted by AWS with a two-minute warning.
D. They are ideal for stateful, critical workloads like databases.
E. They have a fixed hourly price.

Answer: A, C

Explanation: The two defining characteristics of Spot Instances are their potential for huge cost savings (up to 90% off On-Demand) (A) and the fact that they are not guaranteed. AWS can reclaim the capacity at any time, giving your instance a two-minute notification before it is terminated (C). This makes them suitable only for fault-tolerant workloads.

---

Question #: 48
An S3 lifecycle policy is configured to transition objects to S3 One Zone-IA. What is a key consideration for this policy?

A. The objects will be replicated to a second region for durability.
B. The objects will have a lower level of durability and availability than if they were transitioned to S3 Standard-IA.
C. The objects will no longer be instantly accessible.
D. The storage cost will be higher than S3 Standard-IA.

Answer: B

Explanation: By transitioning data to S3 One Zone-IA, you are accepting a lower level of resilience in exchange for a lower storage cost. Because the data is only stored in a single Availability Zone, it is vulnerable to loss in the event of a disaster that affects that entire AZ.

---

Question #: 49
A company wants to commit to a certain level of EC2 usage for one year to get a discount, but they are not sure which instance family they will use. Which purchasing option offers a discount while allowing the flexibility to change instance families?

A. Standard Reserved Instances
B. Convertible Reserved Instances
C. Spot Fleet
D. Dedicated Instances

Answer: B

Explanation: This is the exact use case for Convertible Reserved Instances. They allow you to exchange your reservation for another one of a different instance family, size, or OS during the term. This provides a way to get a good discount while still being able to adapt your infrastructure as your needs change.

---

Question #: 50
What is the primary purpose of setting an expiration (deletion) rule in an S3 lifecycle policy?

A. To improve the performance of S3 GET requests.
B. To automatically delete old, unneeded objects to reduce storage costs.
C. To version objects in the bucket.
D. To encrypt objects after a certain period.

Answer: B

Explanation: An expiration action is a cost and data management tool. It allows you to define a rule that will automatically and permanently delete objects after they reach a certain age. This is crucial for managing data like logs or temporary files that have a finite useful lifespan, as it prevents you from paying for storage indefinitely.

---

Question #: 51
You have purchased a regional Reserved Instance for an m5.large instance in us-east-1. The RI has a size flexibility benefit. Currently, you are not running any m5.large instances, but you are running two m5.large instances. How will the RI discount be applied?
*Correction*: Let's assume the question meant "you are running two m5.xlarge instances" or something different. Let's assume it meant "you are running two m5.large instances". The question is then a bit odd. Let's assume it's a typo and the user meant "you are running two m5.2xlarge instances". Let's rephrase. "you are not running any m5.large instances, but you are running one m5.2xlarge instance".

A. The discount will not be applied as you are not running the exact instance size.
B. The discount for one m5.large will be applied to a portion of the cost of the m5.2xlarge instance.
C. The RI will be automatically converted to cover the m5.2xlarge instance.
D. The discount will be applied to a random instance in your account.

Answer: B

Explanation: Regional RIs with size flexibility are applied based on a normalization factor. An m5.2xlarge is considered 4 "units" while an m5.large is 2 "units". If you have a reservation for an m5.large, the discount for those 2 units of capacity will be applied to a portion of the cost of the larger instance. The remaining portion of the m5.2xlarge's cost will be billed at the On-Demand rate.

---

Question #: 52
Which S3 storage class incurs a per-GB retrieval fee in addition to the monthly storage cost? (Choose TWO)

A. S3 Standard
B. S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA)
C. S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA)
D. S3 Intelligent-Tiering
E. All S3 Glacier storage classes

Answer: B, C, E

Explanation: The trade-off for lower storage costs in the infrequent access and archival tiers is a data retrieval fee. S3 Standard-IA (B), S3 One Zone-IA (C), and all the S3 Glacier classes (E) charge a fee for every gigabyte of data you retrieve from them. S3 Standard (A) has no retrieval fees. S3 Intelligent-Tiering (D) has no retrieval fees for moving data between tiers, only for accessing data that is in an infrequent or archive tier.

---

Question #: 53
A company has a fleet of servers with a very consistent and predictable usage pattern. They want to maximize their savings and are confident in their 3-year forecast. What is the most financially optimal purchasing strategy?

A. Use On-Demand instances and scale down during off-hours.
B. Purchase a 1-year, No Upfront Compute Savings Plan.
C. Purchase 3-year, All Upfront Standard Reserved Instances for their baseline capacity.
D. Use a fleet of Spot Instances.

Answer: C

Explanation: To achieve the maximum possible discount, you should choose the options with the highest commitment. A 3-year term provides a much higher discount than a 1-year term. An All Upfront payment provides a higher discount than Partial or No Upfront. A Standard RI provides a higher discount than a more flexible option like a Savings Plan. Combining these provides the absolute lowest hourly rate.

---

Question #: 54
A lifecycle policy is configured to transition objects to S3 Glacier Deep Archive after 90 days. What is the typical retrieval time for an object from this storage class?

A. Milliseconds
B. 1-5 minutes
C. 3-5 hours
D. 12-48 hours

Answer: D

Explanation: S3 Glacier Deep Archive is designed for long-term archival at the lowest cost, and the trade-off is retrieval time. The "Standard" retrieval tier for Deep Archive is within 12 hours. A "Bulk" retrieval option is also available, which is cheaper per GB but can take up to 48 hours.

---

Question #: 55
What is an EC2 Savings Plan?

A. A plan that provides a discount on all AWS services.
B. A flexible pricing model that offers lower prices than On-Demand, in exchange for a commitment to a consistent amount of compute usage (measured in $/hour) for a 1 or 3-year term.
C. A plan that automatically selects the cheapest EC2 instance for your workload.
D. A way to get a discount on Spot Instances.

Answer: B

Explanation: A Savings Plan is a commitment-based discount model. You agree to pay for a certain amount of compute usage per hour for a term. Any usage up to that commitment is charged at the discounted Savings Plan rate. This is simpler and more flexible than Reserved Instances, as it automatically applies to your usage without you needing to manage the reservations.

---

Question #: 56
For an S3 bucket with versioning enabled, how can you use a lifecycle policy to save costs on storage for old, noncurrent versions?

A. Create a rule to expire noncurrent versions after 0 days.
B. Create a rule to transition noncurrent versions to a lower-cost storage class like S3 Standard-IA or S3 Glacier.
C. This is not possible; all versions are stored in S3 Standard.
D. Create a rule to delete the bucket.

Answer: B

Explanation: A common cost optimization strategy for versioned buckets is to manage the noncurrent versions. You can create a specific lifecycle rule that applies only to noncurrent versions, transitioning them to a cheaper storage class after they have been superseded for a certain number of days (e.g., 30 days). You can also have another rule to permanently delete these noncurrent versions after a longer period.

---

Question #: 57
Which of the following purchasing options offers a discount but does NOT provide a capacity reservation?

A. Zonal Standard Reserved Instance
B. Regional Standard Reserved Instance
C. On-Demand Capacity Reservation
D. Compute Savings Plan

Answer: D

Explanation: Savings Plans provide a financial discount but do not reserve capacity. If you need a guarantee that you can launch a specific instance type in a specific AZ, you must either use a Zonal Reserved Instance or an On-Demand Capacity Reservation. Regional RIs also offer a discount and some size flexibility but do not provide a capacity reservation.

---

Question #: 58
You are storing data that must be immediately accessible but is accessed very infrequently (e.g., once or twice a year). The data must be resilient to the loss of an Availability Zone. Which is the MOST cost-effective storage class?

A. S3 Standard
B. S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA)
C. S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA)
D. S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval

Answer: B

Explanation: S3 Standard-IA is designed for this use case. It stores data across multiple AZs, providing high durability. It offers a lower storage price than S3 Standard, and while it has a retrieval fee, this is cost-effective for data that is truly accessed infrequently. Glacier Instant Retrieval (D) is also an option, but Standard-IA is typically the primary choice for this general "infrequent access" pattern.

---

Question #: 59
A company is running a stateful workload on a single `r5.2xlarge` instance. They anticipate needing to upgrade to an `r5.4xlarge` in about 18 months. They want to get a discount on their compute for a 3-year term. Which RI type should they purchase?

A. A Standard RI for an `r5.2xlarge`.
B. A Convertible RI for an `r5.2xlarge`.
C. A Standard RI for an `r5.4xlarge`.
D. They should use a Savings Plan instead.

Answer: B

Explanation: Since they know they will need to change the instance size during the 3-year term, a Standard RI is not a good choice as it is not flexible. A Convertible RI is the perfect solution. They can purchase one for the `r5.2xlarge` now, and then in 18 months, they can exchange it for a new Convertible RI that covers the `r5.4xlarge` instance.

---

Question #: 60
A bucket has versioning and a lifecycle rule to permanently delete noncurrent versions after 90 days. An object is uploaded on day 1. It is overwritten on day 30. It is deleted on day 50. When is the original version (from day 1) permanently deleted?

A. On day 90
B. On day 120
C. On day 140
D. On day 50

Answer: B

Explanation: The original version (from day 1) becomes a noncurrent version on day 30 when it is overwritten. The 90-day expiration timer for this noncurrent version starts on day 30. Therefore, it will be permanently deleted 90 days after day 30, which is on day 120 (30 + 90). The deletion on day 50 only adds a delete marker and makes the version from day 30 noncurrent.

---

Question #: 61
Which EC2 pricing model allows you to get significant discounts by bidding on unused compute capacity?

A. On-Demand
B. Reserved
C. Spot
D. Dedicated

Answer: C

Explanation: Spot Instances operate on a supply-and-demand market model. You specify the maximum price you are willing to pay for an instance, and as long as the market "Spot price" is below your maximum price, your instance will run. This allows you to access spare EC2 capacity at very large discounts compared to On-Demand prices.

---

Question #: 62
To use S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval or S3 Glacier Deep Archive, how do you place objects into these storage classes?

A. You must upload them directly to the Glacier service via its own API.
B. You can upload them directly to these classes using the S3 API, or transition them from other S3 classes using a lifecycle policy.
C. You must use the AWS Snowball service.
D. You must encrypt the objects first.

Answer: B

Explanation: Objects can be placed into the Glacier storage classes in two ways. You can directly PUT an object into the `GLACIER` or `DEEP_ARCHIVE` storage class via the S3 API. Alternatively, and more commonly for cost optimization, you can use an S3 Lifecycle policy to automatically transition objects from classes like S3 Standard into the Glacier classes after a certain period of time.

---

Question #: 63
A company has a very steady workload and buys a 3-year, All Upfront Standard RI for an m5.large instance. Halfway through the term, they no longer need the instance. What can they do to recoup some of their investment?

A. Cancel the Reserved Instance and get a pro-rated refund.
B. Exchange the RI for a smaller instance type.
C. Attempt to sell the remaining term of their Reserved Instance on the EC2 Reserved Instance Marketplace.
D. Nothing, the investment is lost.

Answer: C

Explanation: The RI Marketplace is a platform that allows customers with Standard RIs to sell their unused reservations to other AWS customers. This provides a way to recover some of the cost if your needs change and you no longer require the specific instance you reserved. Convertible RIs cannot be sold on the marketplace.

---

Question #: 64
Which S3 storage class is MOST appropriate for storing backups of data that can be easily recreated, where low cost is the primary driver and resilience to a single data center failure is not required?

A. S3 Standard
B. S3 Standard-IA
C. S3 One Zone-IA
D. S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval

Answer: C

Explanation: S3 One Zone-IA is specifically designed for this type of use case. It provides a lower storage cost than S3 Standard-IA by storing the data in only a single Availability Zone. This makes it ideal for storing secondary backup copies or other data that can be easily regenerated if the AZ were to fail.

---

Question #: 65
How does an EC2 Instance Savings Plan work?

A. It gives you a discount on any EC2 instance usage, regardless of family or region.
B. It gives you a discount in exchange for a commitment to use a specific instance family in a specific region (e.g., m5 in us-east-1).
C. It gives you a discount on a specific instance type in a specific AZ.
D. It automatically moves your instances to the cheapest available instance type.

Answer: B

Explanation: An EC2 Instance Savings Plan is more specific than a Compute Savings Plan but more flexible than a Standard RI. You commit to a certain spend for a specific instance family in a specific region. In return, you get a discount that applies to any size, OS, or tenancy within that family/region combination.

---

Question #: 66
A company uses a third-party application that is licensed per physical CPU core. To run this application in a cost-effective way and comply with the license, which EC2 option should be used?

A. A Spot Fleet with a diverse set of instance types.
B. On-Demand instances in an Auto Scaling group.
C. A Dedicated Host.
D. A Convertible Reserved Instance.

Answer: C

Explanation: A Dedicated Host provides you with an entire physical server. This is essential for BYOL (Bring Your Own License) scenarios where the license terms are tied to physical hardware attributes like cores or sockets. It gives you the visibility and control needed to prove license compliance.

---

Question #: 67
What is the minimum object size for an object to be eligible for the S3 Standard-IA or S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage classes?

A. There is no minimum size.
B. 1 KB
C. 128 KB
D. 1 MB

Answer: C

Explanation: To be cost-effective, the infrequent access tiers are designed for larger objects. Objects smaller than 128 KB can be stored in S3 Standard-IA or moved into the IA tier of Intelligent-Tiering, but they will be billed for storage as if they were 128 KB in size. Therefore, it is not cost-optimal for very small objects.

---

Question #: 68
A startup is launching a new application and expects its usage to be low at first but to grow rapidly. They want to minimize their initial financial commitment but still get a discount on their compute costs. What is a good strategy?

A. Purchase a 3-year, All Upfront Standard RI.
B. Use On-Demand instances exclusively.
C. Purchase a 1-year, No Upfront Savings Plan with a small initial hourly commitment, and plan to purchase additional plans as usage grows.
D. Use only Spot Instances.

Answer: C

Explanation: A 1-year, No Upfront Savings Plan provides a good balance. The 1-year term is a lower commitment than 3 years. The No Upfront option means no initial cash outlay. By starting with a small hourly commitment that covers their initial baseline, they can get a discount immediately. As their usage grows and becomes more predictable, they can purchase additional Savings Plans to cover the new baseline.

---

Question #: 69
An object is stored in S3 Intelligent-Tiering. It is accessed every day for 45 days, and then not accessed again. What will be the sequence of its storage tiers?

A. It will remain in the Frequent Access tier for the entire duration.
B. Frequent Access for 30 days, then Infrequent Access.
C. Frequent Access for 45 days, then Infrequent Access after another 30 days of no access.
D. Frequent Access for 45 days, then it will be moved to the Infrequent Access tier on day 75.

Answer: D

Explanation: S3 Intelligent-Tiering moves an object to the Infrequent Access tier if it has not been accessed for 30 consecutive days. In this scenario, the object is accessed daily for 45 days, so the 30-day "no access" timer keeps resetting. The timer starts on day 46. After 30 days of no access (on day 75), the object will be moved to the Infrequent Access tier.

---

Question #: 70
Which purchasing option can provide a discount on AWS Fargate usage?

A. Reserved Instances
B. Spot Instances for Fargate
C. Compute Savings Plans
D. Both B and C

Answer: D

Explanation: AWS Fargate, the serverless compute engine for containers, has two discounted pricing models. You can use Compute Savings Plans, which will automatically apply their discount to your Fargate usage. Additionally, AWS offers Fargate Spot, which allows you to run fault-tolerant container tasks on spare capacity at a steep discount, similar to EC2 Spot Instances.

---

Question #: 71
A company has a 3-year Convertible Reserved Instance. What is one of the key benefits they have?

A. They can sell the RI on the marketplace if it's no longer needed.
B. The RI provides the highest possible discount offered by AWS.
C. They can exchange the RI for another of a different instance family, OS, or tenancy.
D. The RI is not billed monthly, only upfront.

Answer: C

Explanation: The defining characteristic of a Convertible RI is the ability to "convert" or exchange it. This allows a company to adapt to new technologies or changing application requirements (e.g., moving from a general-purpose to a compute-optimized instance family) without losing their long-term discounted pricing.

---

Question #: 72
An S3 lifecycle policy is set to delete objects after 1 year. An object is uploaded and then a legal hold is placed on it using S3 Object Lock. What happens after 1 year?

A. The object is deleted by the lifecycle policy.
B. The lifecycle policy fails to delete the object because of the Object Lock.
C. The object is transitioned to Glacier instead of being deleted.
D. The object's version ID is changed.

Answer: B

Explanation: S3 Object Lock is a compliance feature that enforces write-once-read-many (WORM) policies. An object under a legal hold or a retention period cannot be overwritten or deleted by any user or any process, including S3 Lifecycle policies. The expiration action will be ignored for that object until the lock is removed.

---

Question #: 73
For a workload that has a completely predictable, fixed capacity and will run for the next 12 months on `c5.xlarge` instances, which purchasing option will be the most cost-effective?

A. A 1-year Compute Savings Plan
B. A 1-year EC2 Instance Savings Plan for the c5 family.
C. A 1-year Standard Reserved Instance for `c5.xlarge`.
D. On-Demand instances.

Answer: C

Explanation: When the workload is extremely specific and predictable (fixed instance type, size, region, and term), a Standard Reserved Instance will typically offer a slightly higher discount than a more flexible option like a Savings Plan. Because there is no need for flexibility in this scenario, the Standard RI provides the maximum cost savings.

---

Question #: 74
What is the primary cost component of the S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval storage class?

A. A high monthly per-GB storage cost and low retrieval cost.
B. A low monthly per-GB storage cost and a higher per-GB data retrieval fee compared to S3 Standard.
C. A cost per snapshot.
D. A cost per API call, with no storage cost.

Answer: B

Explanation: The pricing model for infrequent access and archival tiers involves a trade-off. You pay a much lower price to store the data per month. However, when you need to access (retrieve) that data, you are charged a per-gigabyte retrieval fee, which is higher than the retrieval cost (which is free) for S3 Standard.

---

Question #: 75
Which statement accurately describes the flexibility of a Compute Savings Plan?

A. It applies only to EC2 instances in a single instance family.
B. It applies only to EC2 instances in a single AWS Region.
C. It applies to EC2, Fargate, and Lambda usage across all instance families, sizes, and regions.
D. It can be sold on the Reserved Instance Marketplace.

Answer: C

Explanation: The Compute Savings Plan is the most flexible discount option. It automatically applies to usage across different compute services (EC2, Fargate, Lambda), instance families, instance sizes, operating systems, tenancies, and AWS Regions, making it ideal for customers with dynamic compute needs.

---

Question #: 76
You have a 50 TB video archive that you need to store at the lowest possible cost. You will almost never need to access it. If you do, a 24-hour retrieval window is perfectly acceptable. Which storage class is the best choice?

A. S3 Standard-IA
B. S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval
C. S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval
D. S3 Glacier Deep Archive

Answer: D

Explanation: This is the exact use case for S3 Glacier Deep Archive. It offers the absolute lowest storage cost in the cloud. The trade-off is a longer retrieval time (12-48 hours), but since this is acceptable for the workload, it is by far the most cost-effective choice for this long-term, cold-storage archive.

---

Question #: 77
A company wants to ensure they always have capacity for 10 `m5.large` instances for a critical application in the `us-east-1a` Availability Zone. What should they purchase?

A. A Regional Reserved Instance for 10 `m5.large` instances.
B. A Zonal Reserved Instance for 10 `m5.large` instances in `us-east-1a`.
C. A Compute Savings Plan for the equivalent cost of 10 `m5.large` instances.
D. A Spot Fleet request for 10 instances.

Answer: B

Explanation: A key benefit of a Zonal Reserved Instance is the capacity reservation. By purchasing a Zonal RI, you are telling AWS that you want a guaranteed slot for that specific instance type in that specific AZ. This ensures that you will always be able to launch those instances, even during periods of high demand in the region. Regional RIs and Savings Plans do not provide this guarantee.

---

Question #: 78
What is the minimum billable object size and storage duration for S3 Standard-IA?

A. 64 KB and 15 days
B. 128 KB and 30 days
C. 256 KB and 60 days
D. There are no minimums.

Answer: B

Explanation: The S3 Standard-IA (and One Zone-IA) storage classes have a minimum billable object size of 128 KB and a minimum storage duration of 30 days. This means that if you store a 10 KB object, you will be billed for 128 KB. If you delete an object after only 10 days, you will be billed for the full 30 days of storage.

---

Question #: 79
A company uses a mix of EC2 and AWS Fargate. Their total compute usage is stable at around $50/hour. They want to get a discount on this usage. Which purchasing option should they choose?

A. A mix of EC2 Reserved Instances and Fargate Reserved Instances.
B. A Compute Savings Plan for $50/hour.
C. An EC2 Instance Savings Plan for $50/hour.
D. Spot Instances for all workloads.

Answer: B

Explanation: A Compute Savings Plan is the ideal choice here because it provides discounts across both EC2 and Fargate usage. By purchasing a single plan, the company can get a discount on their entire compute portfolio without needing to manage separate reservations for each service.

---

Question #: 80
A company has a bucket with versioning enabled. They want to save money by deleting versions of objects that were replaced more than 2 years ago. How can they automate this?

A. This must be done manually with a script.
B. Create an S3 Lifecycle rule to expire noncurrent versions after 730 days.
C. Create an S3 Lifecycle rule to expire current versions after 730 days.
D. Use S3 Intelligent-Tiering to automatically delete old versions.

Answer: B

Explanation: S3 Lifecycle policies can operate on either the current version or the noncurrent (previous) versions of an object. To clean up old versions, you would create a rule that specifically targets noncurrent versions and sets an expiration action to permanently delete them after they have been noncurrent for a specified number of days.

---

Question #: 81
Which EC2 purchasing option provides the most significant discount but carries the risk of the instance being terminated by AWS?

A. On-Demand
B. Reserved Instance
C. Savings Plan
D. Spot Instance

Answer: D

Explanation: Spot Instances offer the largest potential discounts (up to 90%) because you are bidding on AWS's spare, unused compute capacity. The trade-off for this low price is that if AWS needs the capacity back, your instance can be interrupted with a two-minute warning.

---

Question #: 82
A company needs to archive data for 5 years. They need to be able to retrieve specific files within 3-5 hours if required by an auditor. Which storage class offers the best balance of low storage cost and the required retrieval speed?

A. S3 Standard-IA
B. S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval
C. S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval
D. S3 Glacier Deep Archive

Answer: C

Explanation: S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval is designed for archival use cases where occasional, faster retrieval is needed. Its standard retrieval option takes 3-5 hours, which perfectly matches the requirement. This provides a much lower storage cost than the infrequent access tiers while still meeting the auditor's SLA.

---

Question #: 83
What is a key financial benefit of using a Savings Plan over On-Demand pricing?

A. It provides a capacity reservation.
B. It offers a significant discount (up to 72%) in exchange for a 1- or 3-year commitment to a certain amount of usage.
C. It has no time commitment.
D. It eliminates all data transfer costs.

Answer: B

Explanation: The fundamental value proposition of both Savings Plans and Reserved Instances is a financial discount. By committing to use a certain amount of compute over a long term, you help AWS with their capacity planning, and in return, they give you a much lower hourly rate compared to the flexible but more expensive On-Demand model.

---

Question #: 84
A lifecycle policy is configured on a non-versioned bucket to transition objects to S3 Glacier Deep Archive after 90 days and expire them after 10 years. An object is uploaded. After 5 years, it is retrieved. What happens to the object after the retrieval is complete?

A. It remains in S3 Glacier Deep Archive.
B. It is moved back to S3 Standard.
C. It is deleted.
D. A temporary copy is restored, and the original remains in Glacier Deep Archive.

Answer: D

Explanation: Retrieving an object from any of the Glacier tiers is a two-step process. First, you initiate a restore job. When the job is complete, S3 creates a temporary copy of the object in the S3 Standard storage class, which you can then access. The original, archived copy of the object remains unmodified in the Glacier Deep Archive tier.

---

Question #: 85
Which of the following is true for Convertible Reserved Instances?

A. They can be sold on the RI Marketplace.
B. They provide a higher discount than Standard RIs.
C. They can be exchanged for other Convertible RIs with different instance attributes.
D. They do not require a 1- or 3-year term commitment.

Answer: C

Explanation: The defining feature of Convertible RIs is their flexibility. You can exchange them during their term to change attributes like instance family, OS, or tenancy. This allows you to adapt to changing needs while still maintaining a long-term discount.

Question #: 86
For which use case is the S3 Standard storage class the most appropriate and cost-effective choice?

A. Long-term archival of compliance data.
B. Storing a secondary copy of a backup that can be recreated.
C. Storing frequently accessed, performance-sensitive data for a dynamic website.
D. Data with completely unknown and unpredictable access patterns.

Answer: C

Explanation: S3 Standard is optimized for low-latency, high-throughput access. It is the best choice for "hot" data that is frequently accessed and requires instant retrieval, such as images for a popular website, application assets, or data for active analytics. For the other use cases, lower-cost tiers would be more appropriate.

Question #: 87
A company has a Spot Fleet request. What is a key benefit of using a Spot Fleet over a single Spot request?

A. It guarantees that the instances will never be interrupted.
B. It allows you to request capacity across multiple instance types, sizes, and Availability Zones, which increases the likelihood of fulfilling and maintaining your target capacity.
C. It provides a discount on On-Demand instances.
D. It reserves capacity for a specific duration.

Answer: B

Explanation: A Spot Fleet (or an Auto Scaling group configured to use Spot) allows you to define a target capacity and specify a variety of different instance types and AZs that are acceptable for your workload. The Spot service will then attempt to fulfill your capacity request by launching the lowest-priced instances from across all those different Spot pools. This diversification significantly improves the availability and resilience of your workload on Spot.

Question #: 88
A lifecycle policy is set to transition objects to S3 Standard-IA after 30 days. An object is 10 KB in size. After 30 days, it is transitioned. How much storage will this object be billed for in S3 Standard-IA?

A. 10 KB
B. 30 KB
C. 64 KB
D. 128 KB

Answer: D

Explanation: The S3 Standard-IA and One Zone-IA storage classes have a minimum billable object size of 128 KB. Even though the object itself is only 10 KB, it will consume and be billed for 128 KB of storage while it is in that tier.

Question #: 89
A company wants the flexibility of a Savings Plan but needs to ensure it gets the highest possible discount for its `m5` instances in `us-east-1`. They have no other compute usage. Which plan should they choose?

A. A Compute Savings Plan
B. An EC2 Instance Savings Plan
C. A combination of both
D. They should use Reserved Instances instead.

Answer: B

Explanation: An EC2 Instance Savings Plan offers a higher discount than a Compute Savings Plan. The trade-off is less flexibility; it only applies to a specific instance family in a specific region. Since the company's usage is confined to exactly that (m5 in us-east-1), the EC2 Instance Savings Plan will give them the best possible discount for a savings plan model.

Question #: 90
What is the primary cost-saving mechanism of the S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class?

A. It compresses all objects to reduce their size.
B. It automatically moves objects between frequent and infrequent access tiers based on monitoring access patterns.
C. It stores objects in a single Availability Zone.
D. It has no data retrieval fees.

Answer: B

Explanation: S3 Intelligent-Tiering saves you money by automating the tiering process. Instead of you having to guess which objects are infrequently accessed and creating a lifecycle policy, the storage class itself monitors the objects. If an object is not accessed for 30 consecutive days, it is moved to a lower-cost tier automatically, saving you money without any manual effort or performance impact on access.

Question #: 91
You have purchased several Reserved Instances. Where can you go to get a detailed view of how your RIs are being utilized and which of your running instances are receiving the discount?

A. The AWS IAM Console
B. The AWS Cost Explorer and the Reserved Instance utilization reports.
C. The Amazon EC2 Console's instance details page.
D. AWS CloudTrail.

Answer: B

Explanation: AWS Cost Management tools, particularly AWS Cost Explorer, provide detailed reports and visualizations for your RI and Savings Plan utilization. The RI utilization report shows you what percentage of your purchased RI hours were used, helping you identify any waste. The RI coverage report shows what percentage of your total instance usage was covered by reservations.

Question #: 92
Which of the following is a direct cost associated with retrieving a large amount of data from S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval?

A. A per-request fee and a per-GB retrieval fee.
B. Only a fee for the amount of time the data is being restored.
C. Only a data transfer out fee.
D. There are no retrieval costs.

Answer: A

Explanation: Retrieving data from the Glacier tiers involves multiple cost components. There is a small fee for each restore request you make. The main cost is the per-gigabyte fee for the amount of data you are restoring. Finally, if you are transferring the data out to the internet, standard S3 data transfer out fees would also apply.

Question #: 93
For a workload with a consistent, predictable compute requirement, which option generally provides a better discount: a 1-year RI or a 3-year RI?

A. A 1-year RI
B. A 3-year RI
C. They provide the same discount.
D. It depends on the instance type.

Answer: B

Explanation: The longer the commitment term, the greater the discount AWS provides. A 3-year Reserved Instance or Savings Plan will always offer a significantly higher discount (e.g., up to 60-72%) compared to a 1-year commitment for the same instance.

Question #: 94
An S3 lifecycle policy can be based on which of the following criteria?

A. The tags on an object.
B. The size of an object.
C. The age of an object (number of days since creation).
D. All of the above.

Answer: D

Explanation: S3 Lifecycle rules can be quite specific. You can create a rule that applies to all objects in a bucket, or you can filter the scope of the rule based on object prefixes, object tags, or even object size (for multipart uploads). The primary trigger for the action is then the age of the object.

Question #: 95
A company is using Spot Instances for a critical part of their data processing pipeline. They are concerned about interruptions. What feature can help them manage this?

A. Spot Blocks, which reserve Spot instances for a defined duration.
B. On-Demand Capacity Reservations.
C. Rebalance Recommendations and Interruption Notices.
D. A Convertible Reserved Instance.

Answer: C

Explanation: The Spot service provides signals to help you manage interruptions gracefully. A "Rebalance Recommendation" is an early signal that an instance is at an elevated risk of being interrupted. An "Interruption Notice" is the final, two-minute warning that the instance will be reclaimed. Your application can be designed to listen for these signals and proactively start moving work off the instance before it is terminated.

Question #: 96
Which S3 storage class is designed to have the same low latency and high throughput performance as S3 Standard?

A. S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval
B. S3 Glacier Deep Archive
C. S3 Standard-Infrequent Access
D. All of the above.

Answer: C

Explanation: Both S3 Standard-IA and S3 One Zone-IA are designed for rapid access. They provide the same millisecond first-byte latency and high throughput as the S3 Standard class. The only difference in their model is the pricing: they have a lower storage cost but charge a fee for data retrieval.

Question #: 97
You have a 1-year, All Upfront Compute Savings Plan. Three months into the term, you decide you no longer need it. What can you do?

A. Sell the remaining term on a marketplace.
B. Cancel the plan and receive a pro-rated refund.
C. Exchange the plan for a different type.
D. Nothing. A Savings Plan commitment cannot be changed or cancelled once purchased.

Answer: D

Explanation: Unlike Standard RIs, Savings Plans cannot be sold on a marketplace. Once you purchase a Savings Plan for a 1- or 3-year term, you are committed to that hourly spend for the entire duration. The plan cannot be modified or cancelled.

Question #: 98
A company has an archive of old project files. The files are almost never needed, but when they are, the company wants the lowest possible retrieval cost, and they are not concerned about how long the retrieval takes. Which retrieval option for S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval should they choose?

A. Expedited
B. Standard
C. Bulk
D. Instant

Answer: C

Explanation: S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval offers three retrieval speeds. "Bulk" retrieval is the slowest option (typically taking 5-12 hours), but it also has the lowest per-GB retrieval cost. This makes it the most cost-effective choice when retrieval time is not a concern.

Question #: 99
Which of the following describes a scenario where an EC2 Instance Savings Plan would be MORE cost-effective than a Compute Savings Plan?

A. A company runs a diverse and constantly changing mix of EC2, Fargate, and Lambda workloads across many regions.
B. A company runs a very stable workload using only the `m5` instance family in the `us-west-2` region.
C. A company has a short-term project that will only last 3 months.
D. A company needs to be able to sell their commitment if their needs change.

Answer: B

Explanation: An EC2 Instance Savings Plan offers a higher discount than a Compute Savings Plan. The trade-off is that it is less flexible. If your workload is very stable and you are certain you will continue using a specific instance family in a specific region, the EC2 Instance Savings Plan will provide greater savings because you are making a more specific commitment.

Question #: 100
An S3 Lifecycle policy is based on a filter using an object tag ("status": "archive"). What happens to an object that does not have this tag?

A. The lifecycle rule is applied to it by default.
B. The lifecycle rule is not applied to it.
C. The object is deleted immediately.
D. The object is moved to S3 Standard.

Answer: B

Explanation: When you use a filter in a lifecycle rule (based on a prefix, tag, or size), the rule will only evaluate and apply to objects that match that filter. Any object that does not have the "status: archive" tag will be completely ignored by this specific lifecycle rule.
