Answer: B

Question #: 75
An organization uses AWS Organizations and wants to create a rule that when a new account is created, a default set of IAM roles is automatically provisioned. Which service is best suited to react to the `CreateAccount` event and trigger this automation?

C. Amazon SNS
D. AWS CloudFormation

Answer: B

Question #: 76
A Lambda function processes messages from an SQS queue. The function is observed to be running constantly, even when there are no messages, leading to high costs. What is the most likely misconfiguration?

A. The SQS queue is not configured for long polling, causing the Lambda service to poll very rapidly.
B. The Lambda function has a memory leak.
C. The visibility timeout of the queue is set to 0.
D. The Lambda function's timeout is set too high.

Answer: A (This behavior is more typical of self-polling applications, but in the context of Lambda's polling, a lack of long polling can lead to more invocations, some of which may be empty). *A more accurate answer might be a misconfigured wait time in the event source mapping, but A is the closest concept.*

Question #: 77
A message is published to an SNS FIFO topic. The topic has three SQS FIFO queue subscribers. What is true about the message delivery?

A. The message will be delivered to all three queues in a non-deterministic order.
B. The message will be delivered to all three queues, preserving the order relative to other messages within the same message group.
C. Only one of the three queues will receive the message.
D. The message delivery will fail because SNS FIFO cannot have multiple subscribers.

Answer: B

Question #: 79
A developer wants to ensure that a Lambda function is only invoked once every 5 minutes, even if it receives multiple triggers from an SNS topic within that period. How can this be achieved?

A. Set the Lambda concurrency limit to 1.
B. This must be handled within the Lambda function's logic, for example, by using a DynamoDB table to track the last execution time.
C. Configure a delay queue on the SNS topic.
D. Set the batch window on the event source mapping to 300 seconds.

Answer: B

Question #: 80

D. A message is processed by a chain of services one after another.

Answer: B

Question #: 81
A consumer application polling an SQS queue needs to extend the processing time for a specific, complex message beyond the queue's default visibility timeout. Which API call should be used?

Question #: 82
A Lambda function, triggered from API Gateway, needs to start a process that will take 20 minutes to complete. What is the best architectural approach?

A. Increase the Lambda function timeout to 20 minutes.
B. The Lambda function should perform the task synchronously and return the result to API Gateway.
C. The Lambda function should take the request, place a job message in an SQS queue, and immediately return a `202 Accepted` response. A separate, long-running process (like another Lambda function or an EC2 worker) will process the job from the queue.
D. Use a bigger memory size for the Lambda function.

Answer: C (Lambda has a 15-minute maximum timeout).

Question #: 84
To implement a request-response pattern with SQS, a client sends a message and needs to receive a reply. What is a common way to achieve this?

A. The client polls the same queue for a response message.
B. The client sends a message containing a `ReplyTo` attribute that specifies a temporary queue where the server should send the response.
C. The client includes its IP address in the message body.
D. This pattern is not possible with SQS.

Question #: 89
A message is sent to an SQS standard queue. Is there a guarantee that it will be delivered only once?

A. Yes, SQS standard queues guarantee exactly-once delivery.
B. No, standard queues provide at-least-once delivery, meaning a message might be delivered more than once in rare circumstances.
C. No, standard queues provide at-most-once delivery, meaning messages might be lost.
D. It depends on the `maxReceiveCount` configuration.

Question #: 96
An SQS message consumer needs to process a message for 20 minutes. The SQS queue's maximum visibility timeout is 12 hours. What is a potential problem with this design?

A. The message will be deleted before processing is finished.
