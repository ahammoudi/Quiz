Question #: 1
A web application running on an Application Load Balancer (ALB) is experiencing a high volume of malicious requests from a specific set of IP addresses, consistent with a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack. What is the most effective way to block these requests?

A. Create a Network ACL rule to deny the malicious IP addresses.
B. Configure the instances' Security Group to deny the malicious IP addresses.
C. Create an AWS WAF WebACL, associate it with the ALB, and add an IP set match rule to block the addresses and a rule to block XSS attacks.
D. Enable AWS Shield Advanced on the ALB.

Answer: C

Explanation: AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall) is the purpose-built service for this scenario. It operates at the application layer (Layer 7) and can inspect web requests. You can create rules to block common attacks like XSS and SQL injection, and also create IP set match rules to block specific IP addresses. Security Groups (B) and Network ACLs (A) operate at lower network layers and cannot inspect the content of web requests for XSS patterns. AWS Shield (D) is for DDoS protection, not for inspecting and blocking specific attack patterns like XSS.

Question #: 2
An auditor needs to review a log of all API calls made in an AWS account over the last year, including who made the call, from what IP address, and when. Which service provides this information?

A. Amazon CloudWatch Logs
B. VPC Flow Logs
C. AWS CloudTrail
D. AWS Trusted Advisor

Answer: C

Explanation: AWS CloudTrail is the service that provides governance, compliance, and operational auditing for your AWS account. It records all API calls made in your account, whether from the console, CLI, or SDKs. These logs contain the details required by the auditor. CloudWatch Logs (A) is for application and system logs. VPC Flow Logs (B) capture network traffic metadata. Trusted Advisor (D) provides best practice recommendations.
---
Question #: 3
What is the primary function of AWS Shield Standard?

A. To protect against application layer attacks like SQL injection.
B. To provide 24/7 access to the AWS DDoS Response Team (DRT).
C. To provide automatic, no-cost protection against common network and transport layer DDoS attacks.
D. To scan EC2 instances for vulnerabilities.

Answer: C

Explanation: AWS Shield Standard is automatically enabled for all AWS customers at no additional cost. It provides always-on protection from the most common, frequently occurring network (Layer 3) and transport (Layer 4) layer Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. Shield Advanced is the paid tier that provides more comprehensive protection and access to the DRT (B). WAF protects against application layer attacks (A).
---
Question #: 4
A developer wants to create an alarm that triggers if the average CPU utilization of an EC2 instance exceeds 80% for a continuous period of 10 minutes. Which service should be used to create this alarm?

A. AWS CloudTrail
B. Amazon CloudWatch
C. AWS WAF
D. AWS Shield

Answer: B

Explanation: Amazon CloudWatch is the monitoring and observability service for AWS. It collects metrics from services like EC2 (e.g., CPUUtilization). You can create CloudWatch Alarms that watch a specific metric over a time period and perform actions (like sending an SNS notification) if the metric breaches a defined threshold.
---
Question #: 5
Which of the following services can AWS WAF be directly associated with? (Choose TWO)

A. Amazon EC2 Instance
B. Amazon CloudFront Distribution
C. Application Load Balancer (ALB)
D. Network Load Balancer (NLB)
E. Amazon S3 Bucket

Answer: B, C

Explanation: AWS WAF is designed to protect web applications at the edge. It can be directly integrated with Amazon CloudFront, Application Load Balancers (ALB), Amazon API Gateway, and AWS AppSync. It cannot be attached directly to an EC2 instance (A), an NLB (D, which operates at Layer 4), or an S3 bucket (E).
---
Question #: 6
By default, where does CloudTrail deliver its log files?

A. To an Amazon CloudWatch Logs log group.
B. To an Amazon S3 bucket.
C. To an Amazon Kinesis Data Stream.
D. To an encrypted EBS volume.

Answer: B

Explanation: When you create a CloudTrail trail, you must specify an Amazon S3 bucket where the log files will be delivered. You can optionally configure the trail to also deliver logs to CloudWatch Logs for easier real-time analysis and alarming, but S3 is the primary and mandatory destination for the log files themselves.
---
Question #: 7
A company is using AWS Shield Advanced to protect its public-facing web application. What is a key benefit of using this service over Shield Standard?

A. It provides protection against web application layer attacks like cross-site scripting (XSS).
B. It provides access to the AWS DDoS Response Team (DRT) and cost protection for scaling charges incurred during a DDoS attack.
C. It is enabled by default on all AWS accounts at no extra charge.
D. It encrypts all traffic between the application and the end-users.

Answer: B

Explanation: AWS Shield Advanced is a premium, paid service. Its key benefits include more sophisticated and powerful protections, near real-time visibility into attacks, and 24/7 access to the AWS DDoS Response Team (DRT) for assistance during an attack. It also provides "DDoS cost protection," which helps safeguard against scaling charges resulting from a DDoS attack. WAF (A) protects against XSS. Shield Standard (C) is the free tier.
---
Question #: 8
What is a "metric" in the context of Amazon CloudWatch?

A. A log entry generated by an application.
B. A time-ordered set of data points, such as the CPU utilization of an EC2 instance or the latency of an ELB.
C. A rule in AWS WAF that blocks malicious traffic.
D. An API call recorded by CloudTrail.

Answer: B

Explanation: A metric is the fundamental concept in CloudWatch. It represents a variable that you can monitor over time. AWS services publish metrics automatically (e.g., EC2 `CPUUtilization`), and you can also publish your own custom metrics. These time-series data points are what you use to create graphs and set alarms.
---
Question #: 9
An organization wants to prevent users in their AWS account from creating overly permissive security group rules (e.g., allowing SSH from 0.0.0.0/0). They also want to be notified if such a rule is created. Which services can help them achieve this?

A. AWS WAF to block the `ec2:AuthorizeSecurityGroupIngress` action.
B. AWS Config to detect non-compliant resources and AWS Systems Manager to remediate them.
C. AWS Shield to protect the security groups from being modified.
D. CloudTrail to delete the non-compliant rule automatically.

Answer: B

Explanation: AWS Config is the ideal service for this. You can create a Config rule (e.g., the `restricted-ssh` managed rule) that continuously checks security groups for compliance. If a non-compliant rule is created, AWS Config can flag it and trigger a remediation action, such as an AWS Systems Manager Automation document that removes the rule, and also send an SNS notification.
---
Question #: 10
What is a CloudTrail "trail"?

A. A collection of CloudWatch alarms.
B. A specific path that network traffic takes through a VPC.
C. A configuration that enables the delivery of CloudTrail events to a specified S3 bucket and optionally to CloudWatch Logs.
D. A set of rules in a WebACL.

Answer: C

Explanation: To actively log API calls with CloudTrail, you must create a "trail". A trail is a configuration that defines where the event log files are sent (the S3 bucket) and what events are logged (e.g., management events, data events). You can create a trail that applies to a single region or all regions.
---
Question #: 11
AWS WAF uses Web Access Control Lists (Web ACLs) to protect resources. What does a Web ACL contain?

A. A collection of metrics and alarms.
B. A set of rules that define the criteria for inspecting web requests and the action to take (allow, block, or count).
C. A list of IAM users who are allowed to modify the WAF configuration.
D. A log of all DDoS attacks that have been mitigated.

Answer: B

Explanation: A Web ACL is the core component of AWS WAF. It is a container for a set of rules. Each rule specifies a condition to look for in a web request (e.g., a malicious script, a specific source IP) and an action to take if the condition is met. The Web ACL applies these rules to all requests that it receives from the associated resource (like an ALB or CloudFront).
---
Question #: 12
You need to retain CloudTrail logs for 7 years for compliance reasons. How can you achieve this in the most cost-effective manner?

A. Store the logs in CloudWatch Logs with an infinite retention period.
B. Configure the CloudTrail trail to deliver logs to an S3 bucket and use S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class with an S3 Lifecycle policy.
C. Store the logs on an encrypted EBS volume.
D. Enable CloudTrail log file validation.

Answer: B

Explanation: The most cost-effective solution for long-term archival is to use Amazon S3's archival storage classes. You would configure CloudTrail to deliver logs to an S3 bucket. Then, you would create an S3 Lifecycle policy to automatically transition the log files to S3 Glacier Deep Archive (the cheapest storage class) after a certain period (e.g., 90 days) for long-term retention.
---
Question #: 13
What is the difference between a CloudWatch basic monitoring and detailed monitoring for EC2 instances?

A. Basic monitoring is free, while detailed monitoring has a cost.
B. Basic monitoring sends metric data every 5 minutes, while detailed monitoring sends it every 1 minute.
C. Basic monitoring includes CPU and Network metrics, while detailed monitoring adds Memory and Disk metrics.
D. Basic monitoring stores metrics for 15 months, while detailed monitoring stores them for 5 years.

Answer: B

Explanation: The primary difference is the frequency of metric publication. Standard (basic) monitoring for EC2 instances publishes metrics at a 5-minute interval. If you enable detailed monitoring, the EC2 service will publish metrics for that instance at a 1-minute interval, allowing for more granular monitoring and faster alarm response times. Detailed monitoring does have an additional cost.
---
Question #: 14
Which AWS WAF rule type would you use to block traffic from a country where your business does not operate?

A. IP set match rule
B. Geographic match rule
C. SQL injection match rule
D. Size constraint rule

Answer: B

Explanation: AWS WAF provides a geographic match rule condition that allows you to inspect web requests based on the country of origin. You can use this to create a rule that blocks all requests from countries you specify.
---
Question #: 15
A company wants to be alerted if the root user of their AWS account is ever used. How can this be configured?

A. This is not possible as root user activity is not logged.
B. Create an AWS WAF rule to block root user logins.
C. Create a CloudWatch Alarm that monitors the `Root` identity in CloudTrail logs.
D. Create an Amazon CloudWatch Events (EventBridge) rule that triggers on a `ConsoleLogin` event from the root user and sends an SNS notification.

Answer: D

Explanation: This is a critical security best practice. CloudTrail captures all console login events. You can create an EventBridge rule with an event pattern that specifically matches the `ConsoleLogin` event where the `userIdentity.type` is `Root`. The target for this rule would be an SNS topic that notifies your security team immediately.
---
Question #: 16
What is the function of "CloudTrail Log File Validation"?

A. It validates that the IAM permissions for the destination S3 bucket are correct.
B. It checks the log files for syntax errors.
C. It provides a way to verify the integrity of the log files, ensuring they have not been tampered with or altered after being delivered by CloudTrail.
D. It validates that the API calls recorded in the logs were successful.

Answer: C

Explanation: When you enable log file validation, CloudTrail creates a digitally signed digest file for each log. You can use these digest files to mathematically verify that the log files have not been modified since they were written. This is a critical feature for compliance and legal auditing scenarios where log integrity is paramount.
---
Question #: 17
A web application is experiencing a DDoS attack that is overwhelming the servers with a flood of SYN packets (a common TCP-based attack). Which service is designed to mitigate this type of attack automatically?

A. AWS WAF
B. Amazon GuardDuty
C. AWS Shield
D. Amazon Inspector

Answer: C

Explanation: SYN floods are a classic example of a network/transport layer (Layer 3/4) DDoS attack. AWS Shield (both Standard and Advanced) is the service designed to automatically detect and mitigate these types of infrastructure-level attacks before they reach your application. WAF (A) operates at Layer 7 and would not be the primary defense against a SYN flood.
---
Question #: 18
You want to collect the memory utilization percentage metric from a fleet of EC2 instances. What must you do?

A. Enable detailed monitoring on the instances.
B. Install the CloudWatch agent on the instances and configure it to collect the memory metric.
C. This metric is collected by default with basic monitoring.
D. Use VPC Flow Logs to calculate memory usage.

Answer: B

Explanation: By default, the EC2 service does not have visibility into the operating system's memory usage. To get this metric into CloudWatch, you must install the unified CloudWatch agent on your EC2 instances. The agent can then collect system-level metrics (like memory and disk usage) as well as logs, and publish them to CloudWatch as custom metrics.
---
Question #: 19
Which of the following actions can a CloudWatch alarm be configured to perform? (Choose TWO)

A. Stop, terminate, or reboot an EC2 instance.
B. Send a notification to an Amazon SNS topic.
C. Block an IP address using AWS WAF.
D. Create a new CloudTrail trail.
E. Execute a Lambda function.

Answer: A, B

Explanation: CloudWatch alarms can be configured with multiple actions. Common actions include sending a notification to an SNS topic (which can then fan out to email, SMS, etc.) (B), and performing an EC2 action like stopping, terminating, or rebooting an instance (A). You can also trigger an Auto Scaling action. To execute a Lambda function (E), you would typically use SNS as an intermediary.
---
Question #: 20
To comply with a data residency requirement, a company must ensure that all CloudTrail logs are processed and stored only within their designated AWS region. What should they do?

A. This is the default behavior; CloudTrail is a regional service.
B. Create a single-region trail in their designated region.
C. Create a multi-region trail and then use a bucket policy to deny access from other regions.
D. Use AWS WAF to block API calls from outside the region.

Answer: B

Explanation: By default, a trail created in the console is a multi-region trail, which logs events from all regions. To meet the data residency requirement, you must explicitly create a trail and configure it to be a single-region trail, applying it only to the desired region. This ensures that only events from that region are logged and stored in the S3 bucket.
---
Question #: 21
An AWS WAF rule is configured with the action "Count". What happens when a web request matches this rule?

A. The request is blocked, and the WAF logs the request.
B. The request is allowed, and the WAF logs the request.
C. The request is allowed to proceed, but the match is counted in the WAF metrics, and the request is logged.
D. The request is sent to a Lambda function for custom processing.

Answer: C

Explanation: The "Count" action is used for testing rules without affecting traffic. When a request matches a rule set to Count, WAF increments a metric for that rule and logs the request, but it does not interfere with the request's path to the backend resource. This allows you to evaluate how a rule would behave before changing it to "Block" or "Allow".
---
Question #: 22
A company is concerned about unauthorized API activity in their AWS account. They want to set up an alert that fires if there are more than 10 console login failures within a 5-minute period. How can this be achieved?

A. Use AWS Shield Advanced to detect brute-force login attempts.
B. Create a metric filter on a CloudTrail log stream in CloudWatch Logs, and create a CloudWatch alarm based on the resulting metric.
C. Create a WAF rule that counts login failures.
D. This requires a third-party security tool, as AWS services cannot monitor this.

Answer: B

Explanation: This is a classic CloudWatch Logs use case. First, you configure a CloudTrail trail to deliver logs to a CloudWatch Logs log group. Then, you create a Metric Filter for that log group with a pattern that matches console login failure events. This filter generates a custom metric. Finally, you create a CloudWatch Alarm that watches this new metric and triggers if the count exceeds 10 in 5 minutes.
---
Question #: 23
What is a CloudTrail "Data Event"?

A. An API call that modifies a resource, such as `ec2:RunInstances`.
B. An API call that reads or writes data within a resource, such as `s3:GetObject` or `lambda:InvokeFunction`.
C. A login event to the AWS Management Console.
D. A non-API event, such as a scheduled instance retirement.

Answer: B

Explanation: CloudTrail separates events into two main types. Management Events (A, C) are operations that are performed on the resources in your account (e.g., creating an instance, modifying a security group). Data Events, which are high-volume, provide visibility into the data-plane operations performed on or within a resource (e.g., getting an S3 object, invoking a Lambda function). Data events are disabled by default and must be explicitly enabled.
---
Question #: 24
You are viewing a CloudWatch graph for the `CPUUtilization` of an EC2 instance. The graph shows a single data point every 5 minutes. What does this indicate?

A. The instance is stopped.
B. The instance has detailed monitoring enabled.
C. The instance has basic (standard) monitoring enabled.
D. The CloudWatch agent is not installed on the instance.

Answer: C

Explanation: The interval between data points on a CloudWatch graph indicates the monitoring frequency. A 5-minute interval is the period for basic (standard) EC2 monitoring. If detailed monitoring were enabled, you would see data points at a 1-minute interval.
---
Question #: 25
What is the primary purpose of a "rate-based rule" in AWS WAF?

A. To block requests that exceed a certain size.
B. To block requests based on their geographic origin.
C. To block requests from a specific IP address if that address sends more than a defined number of requests in a 5-minute period.
D. To rank the severity of different types of attacks.

Answer: C

Explanation: A rate-based rule is designed to mitigate web-layer DDoS attacks, brute-force login attempts, or web scraping. It tracks the rate of requests from individual source IP addresses. If the number of requests from a single IP exceeds the threshold you set (e.g., 2000 requests in 5 minutes), the rule's action (typically "Block") is triggered for that IP.
---
Question #: 26
For an organization-wide CloudTrail trail, where must the trail be created?

A. In each member account of the organization.
B. In the management account of the AWS Organization.
C. In a dedicated, centralized logging account.
D. In the region with the most resources.

Answer: B

Explanation: To create a trail that collects events from all accounts within an AWS Organization, you must create the trail from within the organization's management (formerly master) account. When you configure the trail, you can specify that it should apply to the entire organization.
---
Question #: 27
Which of the following is a feature provided by AWS Shield Advanced but NOT by Shield Standard?

A. Protection against network layer DDoS attacks.
B. Always-on detection and mitigation.
C. Health-based detection and advanced attack mitigation.
D. No additional charges for data transfer out of AWS.

Answer: C

Explanation: Shield Advanced provides more sophisticated detection and mitigation capabilities. It can use the health of your application (e.g., via Route 53 health checks) as a signal to more quickly and aggressively mitigate attacks. It also employs more advanced routing techniques to scrub malicious traffic. Standard protection (A, B) is more generic.
---
Question #: 28
You have created a CloudWatch custom metric called "PageLoadTime". What is the default resolution at which this metric is stored?

A. 1 second
B. 10 seconds
C. 1 minute
D. 5 minutes

Answer: C

Explanation: When you publish a custom metric to CloudWatch without specifying a storage resolution, it is stored at the standard resolution of 1 minute. You can optionally choose to publish it as a high-resolution metric, which allows for storage at 1-second resolution (at a higher cost).
---
Question #: 29
A security team wants to be proactively notified of potential threats and suspicious activity in their AWS accounts, such as EC2 instances communicating with known malicious IPs or unusual API call patterns. Which service is designed to provide this?

A. Amazon Inspector
B. AWS Trusted Advisor
C. Amazon GuardDuty
D. AWS WAF

Answer: C

Explanation: Amazon GuardDuty is a threat detection service that continuously monitors for malicious activity and unauthorized behavior. It analyzes multiple data sources, including VPC Flow Logs, CloudTrail logs, and DNS logs, using threat intelligence feeds and machine learning to identify potential threats.
---
Question #: 30
You have associated a WebACL with a CloudFront distribution. Where are the WAF rules for this WebACL executed?

A. In the AWS region where the CloudFront distribution was created.
B. In the AWS region of the origin server.
C. At the AWS Edge Locations, close to the end-user.
D. In a centralized WAF processing region.

Answer: C

Explanation: When you associate AWS WAF with CloudFront, the rules are distributed and executed globally across all of CloudFront's edge locations. This means that malicious requests are inspected and blocked at the edge of the AWS network, as close as possible to the user, before they can travel further into your infrastructure.
---
Question #: 31
What is a CloudWatch "Namespace"?

A. A unique identifier for a specific alarm.
B. A container for CloudWatch metrics. Metrics from different services or applications are separated by namespaces.
C. A way to group related dashboards together.
D. The ARN of a log group.

Answer: B

Explanation: A namespace is a way to isolate metrics from one another. All AWS services that report data to CloudWatch use a namespace (e.g., `AWS/EC2`, `AWS/ELB`, `AWS/S3`). When you publish your own custom metrics, you must also define a custom namespace for them.
---
Question #: 32
Is it possible to record API calls made to the AWS KMS service in CloudTrail?

A. No, KMS calls are security-sensitive and are never logged.
B. Yes, all KMS management and cryptographic API calls are recorded as events in CloudTrail.
C. Only management calls like `CreateKey` and `DeleteKey` are logged, not cryptographic calls like `Encrypt`.
D. Only when using AWS Shield Advanced.

Answer: B

Explanation: Auditing key usage is a critical security function. All API calls to KMS, including both management actions (`CreateKey`, `EnableKeyRotation`) and cryptographic actions (`Encrypt`, `Decrypt`, `GenerateDataKey`), are captured as events in CloudTrail. This provides a full audit trail of who is using your keys and when.
---
Question #: 33
An attacker is attempting to exploit a SQL injection vulnerability in your web application. Which service is most effective at preventing this type of attack?

A. Network ACL
B. AWS Shield Standard
C. AWS WAF
D. Security Group

Answer: C

Explanation: SQL injection is an application layer (Layer 7) attack. AWS WAF is designed to operate at this layer and inspect the content of HTTP/S requests. It has built-in, managed rule sets specifically designed to detect and block the patterns associated with SQL injection attacks. The other services operate at lower network layers and do not have this capability.
---
Question #: 34
You need to aggregate logs from hundreds of EC2 instances into a central location for analysis. What is the standard AWS architecture for this?

A. Configure each instance to write logs to its own EBS volume and then snapshot them daily.
B. Configure the CloudWatch agent on each instance to send logs to a central Amazon CloudWatch Logs log group.
C. Configure CloudTrail to pull logs from the EC2 instances.
D. Use AWS WAF to capture the logs.

Answer: B

Explanation: The standard and scalable solution is to use the unified CloudWatch agent. You install and configure the agent on all your instances to monitor specific log files (e.g., `/var/log/httpd/access_log`). The agent then streams these log events in near real-time to a centralized log group in CloudWatch Logs, where you can search, analyze, and create alarms.
---
Question #: 35
A CloudWatch alarm has entered the `INSUFFICIENT_DATA` state. What does this mean?

A. The alarm threshold has been breached.
B. The metric being monitored has stopped reporting data, or there isn't enough data to make a determination.
C. The alarm has been manually disabled.
D. The alarm's action failed to execute.

Answer: B

Explanation: The `INSUFFICIENT_DATA` state indicates that CloudWatch does not have enough data points within the alarm's evaluation period to determine if the state is `OK` or `ALARM`. This commonly happens when an EC2 instance is stopped (so it stops reporting metrics) or when a custom metric has not been published recently.
---
Question #: 36
What is the purpose of an "Aggregate" CloudWatch dashboard?

A. It can display graphs from multiple AWS regions on a single dashboard.
B. It can only display graphs of custom metrics.
C. It aggregates all metrics in the account into a single graph.
D. It is a dashboard that is shared across multiple AWS accounts.

Answer: A

Explanation: A key feature of CloudWatch dashboards is the ability to create cross-region views. An "aggregate" dashboard allows you to add widgets (graphs and metrics) from different AWS regions, providing a single pane of glass to monitor a geographically distributed application.
---
Question #: 37
Which feature of AWS CloudTrail helps ensure that log files delivered to your S3 bucket are encrypted?

A. CloudTrail Log File Validation
B. CloudTrail integration with AWS Organizations
C. Server-Side Encryption (SSE) for the S3 bucket
D. CloudTrail Insights

Answer: C

Explanation: CloudTrail itself does not perform encryption, but it relies on the features of its delivery destination, S3. To encrypt the CloudTrail log files at rest, you must enable server-side encryption (either SSE-S3 or SSE-KMS) on the destination S3 bucket.
---
Question #: 38
You are being targeted by a large, volumetric DDoS attack that is saturating your network bandwidth. You have AWS Shield Advanced. What is the first thing you should do?

A. Manually create WAF rules to block the attacking IPs.
B. Stop all your EC2 instances to reduce costs.
C. Contact the AWS DDoS Response Team (DRT) for assistance.
D. Increase the size of your EC2 instances to handle the traffic.

Answer: C

Explanation: A major benefit of AWS Shield Advanced is access to the 24/7 DDoS Response Team. For complex or high-severity attacks, you should engage the DRT immediately. They can help analyze the attack and apply additional, non-public mitigations to protect your application. While Shield Advanced provides automatic protection, the DRT can provide expert assistance.
---
Question #: 39
A company has a web application that is vulnerable to the "OWASP Top 10" security risks. What is the quickest way to protect the application using AWS WAF?

A. Create a custom rule for each of the OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities.
B. Use a rate-based rule to block high-traffic sources.
C. Subscribe to and use an AWS Managed Rule group, such as the `Core rule set`.
D. Use a geographic match rule to block high-risk countries.

Answer: C

Explanation: AWS Managed Rules for WAF are a curated set of rules maintained by AWS and AWS Marketplace Sellers that help protect against common threats. The `Core rule set` is specifically designed to protect against vulnerabilities identified in the OWASP Top 10 publications. Using this managed rule group is much faster and more effective than trying to create and maintain custom rules for all these threats yourself.
---
Question #: 40
You want to search and analyze your CloudTrail logs using standard SQL queries. What is a common way to achieve this?

A. Configure the trail to deliver logs to an RDS database.
B. Use the search functionality in the CloudTrail console.
C. Configure the trail to deliver logs to S3, and then use Amazon Athena to query the log files.
D. Enable CloudTrail Insights.

Answer: C

Explanation: Amazon Athena is a serverless, interactive query service that makes it easy to analyze data in Amazon S3 using standard SQL. A common and powerful pattern is to point Athena at the S3 bucket containing your CloudTrail logs. This allows you to perform complex ad-hoc queries on your logs without needing to load them into a database.
---
Question #: 41
What is the default retention period for log events stored in an Amazon CloudWatch Logs log group?

A. 1 day
B. 30 days
C. 1 year
D. Never expire

Answer: D

Explanation: By default, when you create a new log group, its retention policy is set to "Never expire". Log events will be stored indefinitely until you manually change the retention setting for that log group. You can configure it to be as short as one day or keep logs forever.
---
Question #: 42
A company is launching a new API using Amazon API Gateway. They want to protect it from common web exploits and control traffic based on IP address. What should they do?

A. Associate an AWS WAF WebACL with the API Gateway stage.
B. Enable AWS Shield Advanced for the API Gateway.
C. Configure a Network ACL for the API Gateway.
D. Launch the API Gateway into a private subnet.

Answer: A

Explanation: AWS WAF can be natively integrated with Amazon API Gateway. By creating a WebACL with the desired rules (e.g., managed rules for common exploits, IP set rules) and associating it with your API stage, you can filter and protect the traffic before it reaches your backend integration.
---
Question #: 43
Which CloudTrail feature uses machine learning to analyze your account's normal API activity patterns and create a baseline, then alerts you to unusual activity that might indicate a security threat?

A. CloudTrail Log File Validation
B. CloudTrail Insights
C. Organization Trails
D. Data Events

Answer: B

Explanation: CloudTrail Insights is a feature that automatically analyzes your CloudTrail management events to detect unusual patterns. It establishes a baseline of normal API call volume and then identifies and alerts on activity that deviates from this baseline, such as spikes in resource provisioning or IAM actions, which could signify a breach.
---
Question #: 44
A CloudWatch alarm for an ELB is configured to watch the `HealthyHostCount` metric. The threshold is set to `< 1` for 3 consecutive periods. What does this alarm signify?

A. The ELB is receiving too much traffic.
B. The ELB has no healthy, in-service instances registered behind it.
C. The latency of the ELB is too high.
D. The ELB has been deleted.

Answer: B

Explanation: The `HealthyHostCount` metric tracks the number of healthy instances registered with a load balancer. An alarm that triggers when this count is less than 1 indicates that there are no backend instances available to serve traffic, which usually means the application is down.
---
Question #: 45
What is the main difference between an AWS WAF "managed rule group" and a "custom rule"?

A. Managed rules are created and maintained by AWS or Marketplace sellers, while custom rules are created and managed by you.
B. Managed rules are free, while custom rules have a monthly cost.
C. Managed rules can only block traffic, while custom rules can allow, block, or count.
D. Managed rules are updated daily, while custom rules are static.

Answer: A

Explanation: This is the key distinction. Managed rule groups (like the Core rule set or Amazon IP reputation list) are pre-configured sets of rules that you can easily add to your WebACL. They are automatically updated by their provider (AWS or a third-party seller) to protect against new threats. Custom rules are rules that you write and manage yourself to address your application's specific needs.
---
Question #: 46
A security incident has occurred, and you need to investigate which IAM user deleted a specific S3 bucket last Tuesday. What is the most direct way to find this information?

A. Check the CloudWatch metrics for the S3 service.
B. Look up the `DeleteBucket` event in the AWS CloudTrail Event history, filtering by the event time and resource name.
C. Run an Amazon Inspector assessment on the S3 service.
D. Check the server access logs for the S3 bucket.

Answer: B

Explanation: The CloudTrail Event history provides a searchable, 90-day record of your account's management events. The most direct way to investigate is to go to the Event history, set a time range for last Tuesday, and filter for the event name `DeleteBucket`. The resulting event will show the user identity that made the API call.

Question #: 48
What is a CloudWatch "dimension"?

A. A name-value pair that helps you uniquely identify a metric.
B. The unit of a metric (e.g., Percent, Bytes, Count).
C. The time period over which a metric is aggregated.
D. A threshold for an alarm.

Answer: A

Explanation: A dimension is a key-value pair that is part of a metric's identity. For example, the `CPUUtilization` metric for EC2 has a dimension of `InstanceId` to distinguish between different instances. You can have up to 10 dimensions per metric, allowing you to slice and dice your metrics for more detailed analysis.
---
Question #: 49
An application is experiencing intermittent errors. You suspect that some EC2 instances are being terminated unexpectedly. How can you confirm which instances were terminated and by whom?

A. Create a CloudWatch alarm on the `StatusCheckFailed` metric.
B. Check the AWS Personal Health Dashboard for service events.
C. Search AWS CloudTrail for the `TerminateInstances` event.
D. Enable detailed monitoring for the instances.

Answer: C

Explanation: AWS CloudTrail is the definitive source for auditing API activity. By searching the CloudTrail event history for the `TerminateInstances` event, you can see a record of every time an instance was terminated, including the instance ID, the timestamp, and the user or role that initiated the action.

Question #: 50
Which of the following attack types is AWS WAF specifically designed to mitigate? (Choose TWO)

A. DDoS SYN Flood
B. SQL Injection
C. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
D. UDP Reflection Attack
E. DNS Query Flood

Answer: B, C

Explanation: AWS WAF operates at Layer 7 (the application layer) and is designed to protect against web application exploits. SQL Injection (B) and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (C) are two of the most common Layer 7 attacks that WAF is built to prevent. The other attacks (A, D, E) are network or transport layer DDoS attacks, which are mitigated by AWS Shield.
---
Question #: 51
You need to create a graph that shows the average, maximum, and minimum CPU utilization for an entire Auto Scaling group of EC2 instances, not just a single instance. How can you do this in CloudWatch?

A. This is not possible; you must graph each instance separately.
B. Create a custom metric that averages the CPU of all instances.
C. In the CloudWatch console, select the `CPUUtilization` metric and aggregate it across the `AutoScalingGroupName` dimension.
D. Use a Lambda function to calculate the aggregates and publish them as a new metric.

Answer: C

Explanation: CloudWatch allows you to aggregate metrics across dimensions. When you select a metric like `CPUUtilization`, instead of choosing a specific `InstanceId`, you can choose to graph the metric by `AutoScalingGroupName`. CloudWatch will then automatically aggregate the data from all instances in that group and allow you to graph the average, max, min, or sum.
---
Question #: 52
When creating a CloudTrail trail, you are given the option to log "Data Events". For which two services are Data Events commonly enabled for security monitoring?

A. Amazon EC2
B. Amazon S3
C. AWS Lambda
D. Amazon VPC
E. AWS IAM

Answer: B, C

Explanation: While Data Events are available for several services, they are most frequently used for Amazon S3 and AWS Lambda. Enabling S3 Data Events lets you log object-level API operations (like `GetObject`, `PutObject`, `DeleteObject`), which is critical for data security auditing. Enabling Lambda Data Events lets you log function invocations (`InvokeFunction`), which is useful for tracking application execution.
---
Question #: 53
A company wants to apply a consistent set of WAF rules to dozens of different Application Load Balancers across multiple accounts in their AWS Organization. What is the most efficient way to manage this?

A. Manually create the same WebACL in each account.
B. Use AWS CloudFormation StackSets to deploy the same WAF configuration to all accounts.
C. Use AWS Firewall Manager to centrally configure and deploy WAF rules across the organization.
D. Use a Lambda function to periodically sync the WAF rules.

Answer: C

Explanation: AWS Firewall Manager is a security management service specifically designed for this purpose. It allows you to centrally configure and manage firewall rules (including AWS WAF, AWS Shield Advanced, and Security Groups) across all the accounts and resources in your AWS Organization. This ensures consistent policy enforcement and simplifies administration.
---
Question #: 54
What is the maximum retention period for metrics in Amazon CloudWatch?

A. 14 days
B. 90 days
C. 15 months
D. Indefinitely

Answer: C

Explanation: CloudWatch retains metric data for 15 months. However, the resolution of the data changes over time. High-resolution data is kept for a short period, then it's rolled up into 1-minute data points, then 5-minute, then 1-hour, and so on. This allows for long-term trend analysis while managing storage costs.
---
Question #: 55
You receive a notification from Amazon GuardDuty about a "Trojan" finding related to one of your EC2 instances. What does this likely indicate?

A. The instance has a port open to the internet that should be closed.
B. The instance is making DNS requests to a domain associated with malware.
C. The instance's CPU utilization is unusually high.
D. The instance has failed its system status checks.

Answer: B

Explanation: GuardDuty uses threat intelligence feeds that contain lists of known malicious domains and IP addresses. A "Trojan" finding often means that GuardDuty has detected that your EC2 instance is communicating with a command-and-control (C&C) server or another IP address known to be associated with malware or botnets.
---
Question #: 56
You want to create a filter in CloudWatch Logs to find all log events that contain the words "ERROR" or "WARN". What is the correct filter pattern syntax?

A. `ERROR AND WARN`
B. `ERROR OR WARN`
C. `?ERROR ?WARN`
D. `[ERROR, WARN]`

Answer: C

Explanation: The CloudWatch Logs filter pattern syntax uses a question mark `?` to indicate an optional term. The pattern `?ERROR ?WARN` will match any log event that contains either the term "ERROR" or the term "WARN" (or both).
---
Question #: 57
Which of the following is a valid action that can be taken based on an AWS WAF rule?

A. `ALLOW`
B. `DENY` (which is `BLOCK`)
C. `COUNT`
D. All of the above.

Answer: D

Explanation: AWS WAF rules have three primary terminal actions. `ALLOW` explicitly permits the request, bypassing any lower-priority rules. `BLOCK` denies the request. `COUNT` allows the request but logs it and increments a metric, which is useful for testing.
---
Question #: 58
How long is CloudTrail event history retained and searchable in the CloudTrail console?

A. 7 days
B. 30 days
C. 90 days
D. 1 year

Answer: C

Explanation: The CloudTrail console provides the "Event history" feature, which allows you to view, search, and download the past 90 days of your account's management events. For retention beyond 90 days, you must configure a trail to deliver logs to an S3 bucket.
---
Question #: 59
What is a CloudWatch Logs "Subscription Filter"?

A. A filter that determines which logs are sent from EC2 to CloudWatch Logs.
B. A way to get a real-time feed of log events from a log group and have them delivered to another service like Amazon Kinesis, Kinesis Data Firehose, or AWS Lambda.
C. A filter that controls which IAM users can subscribe to a log group.
D. A filter that automatically deletes log events that match a certain pattern.

Answer: B

Explanation: A subscription filter allows you to perform real-time processing of your log data. You can match log events with a specific pattern and have them streamed to another service. A common use case is streaming logs to a Kinesis stream for complex real-time analytics or to a Lambda function for custom alerting or remediation.
---
Question #: 60
An Application Load Balancer is protected by AWS WAF. A user reports that their legitimate request is being blocked. What is the first step you should take to troubleshoot the issue?

A. Disable WAF entirely.
B. Check the AWS Shield dashboard for DDoS events.
C. Check the WAF logs to see which rule is matching and blocking the request.
D. Check the Security Group of the backend instance.

Answer: C

Explanation: AWS WAF provides detailed logs of the requests it inspects. The first step in troubleshooting a false positive (a blocked legitimate request) is to analyze the WAF logs. The logs will show the details of the request and, most importantly, which specific rule in your WebACL was matched, leading to the "BLOCK" action. You can then refine that rule to be more specific.
---
Question #: 61
Which service provides a detailed report on the configuration of your AWS resources and can track changes to those configurations over time?

A. AWS CloudTrail
B. Amazon CloudWatch
C. AWS Config
D. AWS Trusted Advisor

Answer: C

Explanation: AWS Config is the service that provides a resource inventory, configuration history, and configuration change notifications. It allows you to discover your AWS resources, record their configurations, and see how a resource and its relationships have changed over time. This is invaluable for auditing, security analysis, and change management.
---
Question #: 62
You have a CloudWatch alarm that sends a notification to an SNS topic when it enters the ALARM state. The issue is resolved, and the alarm returns to the OK state. By default, will another notification be sent?

A. Yes, a notification is sent for every state change.
B. No, notifications are only sent when the alarm enters the ALARM state.
C. It depends on the metric being monitored.
D. Only if you have configured a separate action for the OK state.

Answer: B

Explanation: By default, an alarm action (like sending an SNS notification) is configured to trigger only on the transition into the `ALARM` state. You can, however, configure separate actions for the `OK` and `INSUFFICIENT_DATA` states if you want to be notified when the situation is resolved.
---
Question #: 63
Which type of AWS WAF rule would you use to block requests that appear to be trying to exploit a Log4j vulnerability by looking for specific patterns in the URI or request body?

A. IP set match rule
B. Rate-based rule
C. Regular expression (regex) match rule
D. Geographic match rule

Answer: C

Explanation: To find specific, complex patterns within a request, you would use a regex match rule. This allows you to define a regular expression pattern (e.g., looking for `${jndi:ldap...}`) and have WAF block any request where a component (like the URI, a header, or the body) matches that pattern. AWS also provides managed rules for this specific vulnerability.
---
Question #: 64
What is the primary difference in scope between Amazon GuardDuty and Amazon Inspector?

A. GuardDuty monitors network traffic, while Inspector monitors API calls.
B. GuardDuty is a threat detection service that monitors for malicious activity, while Inspector is a vulnerability assessment service that checks for known vulnerabilities on EC2 instances.
C. GuardDuty is a regional service, while Inspector is a global service.
D. GuardDuty is free, while Inspector is a paid service.

Answer: B

Explanation: This is a key distinction. GuardDuty is a detective service that analyzes logs in near real-time to find evidence of active threats (e.g., an instance communicating with a C&C server). Inspector is a preventative scanning service. It runs assessments on your EC2 instances to check for common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVEs) and deviations from security best practices *before* they are exploited.
---
Question #: 65
You want to view the top 10 source IP addresses making requests to your Application Load Balancer over the past hour. How could you achieve this using CloudWatch?

A. This is not possible with CloudWatch.
B. Enable detailed monitoring on the ALB.
C. Use CloudWatch Logs Insights to run a query against your ALB access logs.
D. Create a CloudWatch dashboard with a metric for each IP address.

Answer: C

Explanation: CloudWatch Logs Insights is a powerful interactive query tool. Assuming you have enabled access logs for your ALB and are sending them to CloudWatch Logs, you can use Logs Insights to write SQL-like queries. A query like `stats count(*) by sourceIP | sort @count desc | limit 10` would give you exactly the information you need.
---
Question #: 66
A CloudTrail trail can be configured to deliver events from all AWS regions to a single S3 bucket. What is this type of trail called?

A. A global trail
B. A multi-region trail
C. A centralized trail
D. An organization trail

Answer: B

Explanation: When you create a trail, you have the option to apply it to "All regions". This is known as a multi-region trail, and it is a best practice as it ensures you capture API activity regardless of the region in which it occurs. This creates a consolidated log of all activity in your account.
---
Question #: 67
What is the purpose of the "Bot Control" managed rule group in AWS WAF?

A. To block all traffic that is not from a human user.
B. To provide visibility into and control over common and pervasive bot traffic, such as scrapers, scanners, and crawlers.
C. To allow traffic only from specific, approved bots like search engine crawlers.
D. To challenge requests with a CAPTCHA to prove the user is human.

Answer: B

Explanation: The Bot Control rule group is designed to identify and manage automated bot traffic. It uses various detection techniques to categorize bots (e.g., scrapers, search engines, site monitors). It can then provide visibility into this traffic and allow you to block or rate-limit the undesirable bots while allowing the legitimate ones.
---
Question #: 68
What is the minimum period you can set for a CloudWatch alarm?

A. 1 second
B. 10 seconds
C. 30 seconds
D. 1 minute

Answer: B

Explanation: For standard resolution metrics, the minimum alarm period is 1 minute. However, if you are using high-resolution custom metrics (published at a 1-second interval), you can set the alarm period to either 10 seconds or 30 seconds for much faster alerting.
---
Question #: 69
To ensure the integrity and authenticity of CloudTrail logs, which two features should be enabled? (Choose TWO)

A. Log file validation
B. Log file encryption using SSE-KMS
C. Log file aggregation from all regions
D. Log file delivery to CloudWatch Logs
E. Log file lifecycle policies

Answer: A, B

Explanation: Log file integrity is about ensuring the logs are not tampered with. Log file validation (A) creates a digital signature for the logs, allowing you to prove they haven't been changed. Log file encryption (B), especially with a customer-managed KMS key where you control access, adds another layer of protection by preventing unauthorized users from even reading the logs.
---
Question #: 70
You are being targeted by a complex application-layer DDoS attack (e.g., an HTTP flood) that AWS Shield is not automatically mitigating. You have Shield Advanced. What should you do?

A. Increase the size of your web servers.
B. Engage the AWS DDoS Response Team (DRT) and work with them to create custom AWS WAF rules.
C. Temporarily shut down your application.
D. Switch to a Network Load Balancer.

Answer: B

Explanation: For application-layer (Layer 7) attacks, the primary mitigation tool is AWS WAF. While Shield Advanced provides some automatic L7 mitigation, complex attacks often require custom rules. Engaging the DRT is the best course of action. They can help analyze the attack traffic and craft specific WAF rules to block the malicious requests while allowing legitimate traffic through.
---
Question #: 71
What does a single data point in a CloudWatch metric represent?

A. An aggregation of measurements collected over a specific time period (e.g., the average over 1 minute).
B. A single log entry from an application.
C. An individual API call.
D. The last known value for a measurement.

Answer: A

Explanation: CloudWatch works by aggregating data over a time interval called a period. When you publish data points for a metric, CloudWatch groups them by the period (e.g., 1 minute). A single data point on a graph for that period represents a statistic (like Average, Sum, Maximum) calculated from all the measurements received during that minute.
---
Question #: 72
An organization has a strict policy that no S3 buckets should ever be made public. How can they be automatically notified if a bucket policy is changed to allow public access?

A. Use Amazon Macie to scan for public buckets.
B. Use AWS Shield to prevent public access.
C. Use AWS Config to monitor S3 bucket policies for compliance and send an SNS notification if a change is detected.
D. Use AWS WAF to block requests to public buckets.

Answer: C

Explanation: AWS Config is the ideal service for this. You can enable the managed Config rule `s3-bucket-public-read-prohibited`. This rule will continuously monitor your S3 buckets. If any bucket's policy or ACLs are changed to allow public read access, the bucket will be flagged as non-compliant, and you can configure AWS Config to send a notification via SNS.
---
Question #: 73
Which of the following is an example of a "Management Event" in CloudTrail?

A. An S3 `GetObject` request.
B. An EC2 `RunInstances` API call.
C. A user logging into an application running on EC2.
D. A DynamoDB `PutItem` operation.

Answer: B

Explanation: Management events are operations that modify the state or configuration of resources in your account. `RunInstances` creates a new EC2 resource, so it is a management event. The others are data events (A, D) or application-level events not captured by CloudTrail (C).
---
Question #: 74
What is the purpose of a "composite alarm" in CloudWatch?

A. It combines metrics from multiple AWS accounts.
B. It allows you to create an alarm that is based on the state of several other alarms.
C. It combines logs and metrics into a single alarm.
D. It is an alarm that can trigger multiple actions.

Answer: B

Explanation: A composite alarm allows you to create more complex alarming logic. It takes as input the state of other CloudWatch alarms. For example, you could create a composite alarm that only enters the `ALARM` state if `Alarm-CPU` is in ALARM *AND* `Alarm-Latency` is in ALARM, reducing alerting noise.
---
Question #: 75
What is the function of the AWS Managed IP Lists in AWS WAF?

A. They are lists of your own company's IP addresses that should always be allowed.
B. They are lists, maintained by AWS, of IP addresses known to be associated with threats like botnets or scanners.
C. They are lists of IP addresses belonging to AWS services.
D. They are lists of IP addresses that have been blocked by AWS Shield.

Answer: B

Explanation: AWS WAF provides several AWS Managed Rule groups, including IP reputation lists. These are lists of IP addresses that AWS has identified through its own threat intelligence as being associated with malicious actors, botnets, etc. You can easily add these rule groups to your WebACL to block traffic from these known bad sources.

Question #: 76
You want to search through several weeks of application logs stored in CloudWatch Logs to find a specific error message. What is the most efficient tool for this?

A. CloudWatch Logs Insights
B. CloudWatch Dashboards
C. CloudWatch ServiceLens
D. Manually downloading the logs and using `grep`.

Answer: A

Explanation: CloudWatch Logs Insights is a purpose-built, high-performance query engine for your log data. It allows you to write powerful queries to search and analyze terabytes of log data in seconds, which is far more efficient than manual searching or downloading.
---
Question #: 77
A trail is configured in `us-east-1` to deliver logs to an S3 bucket in `us-west-2`. The trail is configured to apply to all regions. If a user launches an EC2 instance in `eu-central-1`, where will the event be logged?

A. It will not be logged.
B. It will be logged and the log file will be delivered to the S3 bucket in `us-west-2`.
C. The log file will be delivered to a bucket in `eu-central-1`.
D. The log file will be delivered to a bucket in `us-east-1`.

Answer: B

Explanation: A multi-region trail captures events from all regions and consolidates them into a single, specified S3 bucket. Even though the API call happened in `eu-central-1` and the trail was defined in `us-east-1`, the log file containing that event will be delivered to the single destination bucket, which in this case is in `us-west-2`.
---
Question #: 78
Which of the following would you use to protect a web application from a Slowloris attack (an application-layer DDoS attack that tries to keep many connections to the web server open for as long as possible)?

A. AWS Shield Standard
B. Network ACLs
C. AWS WAF and an Application Load Balancer
D. VPC Flow Logs

Answer: C

Explanation: A Slowloris attack is a Layer 7 attack. An Application Load Balancer, combined with AWS WAF, is effective at mitigating it. The ALB can handle a large number of connections, and you can configure WAF with rate-based rules or other rules that can identify and block the slow, lingering connections characteristic of this attack.
---
Question #: 79
You need to be notified via email when a specific CloudWatch alarm is triggered. What is the correct sequence of services to use?

A. CloudWatch Alarm -> AWS Lambda -> Amazon SES
B. CloudWatch Alarm -> Amazon SQS -> EC2 worker
C. CloudWatch Alarm -> Amazon SNS -> Email Subscription
D. CloudWatch Alarm -> Amazon EventBridge -> Amazon SQS

Answer: C

Explanation: This is the standard pattern for notifications. You configure the CloudWatch alarm's action to be "notify" an Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service) topic. You then create an email subscription to that SNS topic. When the alarm fires, it publishes a message to the topic, and SNS then sends that message to all its subscribers, including your email address.
---
Question #: 80
Which statement about CloudTrail is true?

A. CloudTrail is enabled by default for all AWS accounts and records the last 90 days of management events.
B. CloudTrail must be manually enabled by creating a trail.
C. CloudTrail only logs API calls made from the AWS Management Console.
D. CloudTrail only logs read-only API calls.

Answer: A

Explanation: Since 2017, CloudTrail has been enabled by default on all AWS accounts. It automatically records the past 90 days of management event history, which is viewable in the CloudTrail console's "Event history". To retain logs beyond 90 days or to log data events, you must create a trail.
---
Question #: 81
What is the primary purpose of a CloudWatch Dashboard?

A. To configure new alarms and metrics.
B. To provide a customizable, single-view console of metrics and alarms from your AWS resources.
C. To store log data from applications.
D. To audit API calls made in the account.

Answer: B

Explanation: A CloudWatch Dashboard allows you to create a customized view with widgets that display graphs of your most important metrics, the current state of alarms, and other visualizations. It serves as a "single pane of glass" for monitoring the health and performance of your applications.
---
Question #: 82
You want to block any request to your website that contains a specific malicious string in the "User-Agent" header. What AWS WAF rule component would you use?

A. IP set
B. String match condition
C. Size constraint condition
D. Geographic match condition

Answer: B

Explanation: A string match condition (or in WAFv2, a rule statement that inspects a header) is used to look for specific text within a part of the web request. You would configure it to inspect the `User-Agent` header and block the request if it contains the malicious string you've identified.
---
Question #: 83
Which AWS service can be used to automatically remediate a non-compliant resource detected by AWS Config?

A. AWS Systems Manager
B. AWS CloudTrail
C. AWS Trusted Advisor
D. Amazon GuardDuty

Answer: A

Explanation: AWS Config integrates with AWS Systems Manager to provide auto-remediation. When a Config rule flags a resource as non-compliant, it can be configured to trigger a Systems Manager Automation document. This document can contain the steps needed to automatically bring the resource back into a compliant state (e.g., remove a permissive security group rule).
---
Question #: 84
A CloudTrail log entry shows that the `invokedBy` field is `ec2.amazonaws.com`. What does this indicate?

A. The API call was made by a user logged into an EC2 instance.
B. The API call was made by an AWS service (in this case, EC2) on your behalf.
C. The API call was made from the EC2 console.
D. The API call originated from a malicious IP address.

Answer: B

Explanation: The `invokedBy` field indicates when an AWS service makes an API call on your behalf. For example, if an EC2 Auto Scaling policy launches a new instance, the `RunInstances` event in CloudTrail would show that it was invoked by the EC2 service principal.
---
Question #: 85
What is the difference in scope between an AWS WAF WebACL and a Security Group?

A. WAF protects against network-layer attacks, while Security Groups protect against application-layer attacks.
B. WAF is applied at the subnet level, while Security Groups are applied at the VPC level.
C. WAF inspects the content of web requests (Layer 7), while Security Groups act as a stateful firewall for an instance, filtering traffic based on port and protocol (Layers 3/4).
D. WAF is a global service, while Security Groups are regional.

Answer: C

Explanation: This is the fundamental difference. WAF is a web application firewall that understands HTTP/S and can inspect things like headers, body content, and URIs. Security Groups are network firewalls that control access to an ENI/instance based on protocol, port, and source/destination IP, without looking inside the packets.
---
Question #: 86
You need to create a CloudWatch alarm that triggers when a specific error message appears in your application's log file. What is the first step?

A. Create the CloudWatch alarm and specify the error message as the threshold.
B. Configure the CloudWatch agent to stream the log file to CloudWatch Logs.
C. Create an SNS topic for the notification.
D. Enable detailed monitoring on the EC2 instance.

Answer: B

Explanation: Before you can alarm on log data, that data must be in CloudWatch. The first step is to install and configure the CloudWatch agent on the server to monitor the application log file and send its contents to a CloudWatch Logs log group. After that, you can create a metric filter and an alarm.
---
Question #: 87
When an organization trail is created, what does CloudTrail do in the member accounts?

A. It creates a new S3 bucket in each member account.
B. It creates a read-only IAM role that the management account can assume.
C. It does nothing; member accounts must opt-in manually.
D. It creates a new trail in each member account that points to the central S3 bucket.

Answer: D

Explanation: When you enable an organization trail from the management account, CloudTrail automatically creates a trail with the same name in each member account. This trail in the member account is configured to send its logs to the centralized S3 bucket specified in the management account's configuration.
---

What is a key benefit of using AWS WAF Managed Rules over creating all your own custom rules?

A. Managed rules are less expensive to run.
B. Managed rules are updated automatically by security experts to protect against new and emerging threats.
C. Managed rules have lower latency than custom rules.
D. Managed rules can be applied to Network Load Balancers.

Answer: B

Explanation: The most significant advantage of managed rules is that you benefit from the expertise of the provider (AWS or a Marketplace seller). They continuously analyze the threat landscape and update the rule sets to protect against new vulnerabilities and attack vectors, saving you the effort and risk of managing this yourself.
---
Question #: 92
Which statistics can you use when creating a CloudWatch alarm?

A. Average, Sum, Minimum, Maximum, SampleCount
B. Only Average and Sum
C. Any custom calculation using a Lambda function
D. All of the above are valid in some context.

Answer: D

Explanation: For standard metrics, you can alarm on basic statistics like Average, Sum, Min, Max, and SampleCount (A). CloudWatch also supports more advanced alarming features like percentile statistics (`p95`, `p99`) and metric math, which allows you to perform calculations on metrics and alarm on the result. A Lambda function could be used to create a custom metric, which could then be alarmed on. So, in a broad sense, all are possible.
---
Question #: 93
A company wants to ensure that CloudTrail is enabled in all of its AWS accounts and that no user can disable it. The company uses AWS Organizations. What is the best way to enforce this?

A. Use an IAM policy in each account to deny `cloudtrail:StopLogging`.
B. Use a Service Control Policy (SCP) attached to the organization root to deny `cloudtrail:StopLogging` and `cloudtrail:DeleteTrail`.
C. Run a daily audit script to check if CloudTrail is enabled.
D. Use AWS WAF to block the CloudTrail API calls.

Answer: B

Explanation: A Service Control Policy (SCP) is the most powerful and effective way to enforce this. By attaching an SCP to the organization's root or a specific OU, you can create a preventative guardrail that applies to all accounts, including the root user of those accounts. Denying the actions to stop or delete trails ensures that CloudTrail remains active.
---

You want to graph the 99th percentile (`p99`) latency of your Application Load Balancer. What must be true?

A. The ALB must have detailed monitoring enabled.
B. The ALB must be sending its metrics to CloudWatch as high-resolution metrics.
C. You can simply select the `p99` statistic for the ALB's latency metric in the CloudWatch console.
D. You must calculate the percentile yourself using a Lambda function.

Answer: C

Explanation: Many AWS services, including Application Load Balancers, publish metrics that support percentile statistics directly. In the CloudWatch console, when you graph the `TargetConnectionErrorCount` or `Latency` metrics for an ALB, you can simply choose a percentile statistic like `p95`, `p99`, or `p99.9` from the list of available statistics.

Question #: 95
Which AWS service would you use to find out if one of your EC2 instances is part of a Bitcoin mining operation?

A. Amazon Inspector
B. AWS Trusted Advisor
C. Amazon GuardDuty
D. AWS CloudTrail

Answer: C

Explanation: Amazon GuardDuty is specifically designed to detect this type of threat. It analyzes network traffic patterns from VPC Flow Logs and DNS logs. If it detects that your EC2 instance is communicating with IP addresses or domains known to be associated with cryptocurrency mining, it will generate a `CryptoCurrency` finding to alert you.

Question #: 96
What is the purpose of the `aws-waf-logs-` S3 bucket that gets created when you enable WAF logging?

A. To store the WAF WebACL configuration as a JSON file.
B. To store detailed, request-by-request logs of the traffic that AWS WAF has inspected.
C. To store metrics about how many requests have been blocked or allowed.
D. To store a backup of your protected application.

Answer: B

Explanation: When you enable logging for a WebACL, AWS WAF sends detailed logs for each inspected request to a delivery stream (usually Kinesis Data Firehose), which then typically stores them in a designated S3 bucket. This bucket contains the raw log data that you can use for detailed analysis and troubleshooting.
---
Question #: 97
You have configured a CloudTrail trail to deliver logs to CloudWatch Logs. You want to be alerted in near real-time when a security group is changed. What should you do?

A. Create a CloudWatch alarm on the `CPUUtilization` of the CloudTrail service.
B. Create a metric filter on the CloudTrail log group that matches the `AuthorizeSecurityGroupIngress` event, and create an alarm on the resulting metric.
C. Use Amazon Athena to query the logs every 5 minutes.
D. Manually inspect the CloudTrail console every hour.

Answer: B

Explanation: This is the standard method for real-time alerting on API activity. The log event is sent to CloudWatch Logs. The metric filter matches the specific event pattern in near real-time and increments a custom metric. The CloudWatch alarm watches this metric and can trigger an action (like an SNS notification) within a minute or two of the actual event occurring.
---
Question #: 98
An application is consistently being scanned by vulnerability assessment tools from various unknown IP addresses. What is the most effective and lowest-maintenance way to block this activity using AWS WAF?

A. Create a custom rule to block the user agent of each scanner.
B. Subscribe to the Amazon IP reputation list managed rule group.
C. Create a rate-based rule to block the IPs.
D. Manually add each scanner's IP address to an IP set.

Answer: B

Explanation: The Amazon IP reputation list is a managed rule group that contains IP addresses known to be associated with threats like scanners and bots. By subscribing to this list, you leverage AWS's threat intelligence to automatically block these scanners without having to identify them or maintain the IP list yourself. This is far more efficient than manual methods.
---
Question #: 99
A developer needs to provide an application running on an EC2 instance with temporary access to an S3 bucket. What is the most secure way to grant this access without storing long-term credentials on the instance?

A. Create an IAM user, generate access keys, and store them in a configuration file on the EC2 instance.
B. Create an IAM role with the necessary S3 permissions and attach it to the EC2 instance via an instance profile.
C. Embed the AWS root user access keys directly into the application code for simplicity.
D. Create a new IAM user and hardcode its access keys as environment variables on the EC2 instance.

Answer: B

Explanation: Using an IAM role (via an instance profile) is the most secure method. The application automatically receives temporary, rotated credentials through the EC2 metadata service, eliminating the need to store long-term keys on the instance. Option A and D are insecure because they involve storing static, long-term credentials on the instance. Option C is a major security violation; the root user should never be used for application access.
---
Question #: 100
An organization wants to enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all IAM users before they can perform any actions on critical S3 buckets. Which IAM policy element is essential for this requirement?

A. The "Principal" element to specify which users must use MFA.
B. The "Condition" element with the "aws:MultiFactorAuthPresent" key.
C. The "Action" element to list all possible MFA device types.
D. The "Effect" element set to "Allow" for all users.

Answer: B

Explanation: The "Condition" element is used to enforce specific circumstances for a policy. To enforce MFA, you use the condition key "aws:MultiFactorAuthPresent" set to "true" in a Deny policy or "false" in an Allow policy, effectively blocking actions if the user's session wasn't authenticated with MFA. Option A specifies who the policy applies to but doesn't enforce MFA. Options C and D are incorrect elements for this purpose.
---
Question #: 101
A company has a team of database administrators who all require the same level of access to Amazon RDS instances. What is the most efficient way to manage their permissions according to AWS best practices?

A. Create an IAM policy and attach it individually to each administrator's IAM user account.
B. Create a single IAM user account and share the credentials with the entire team.
C. Create an IAM group, attach a single IAM policy to the group, and add all the administrators' IAM users to that group.
D. Create one IAM role for each database administrator.

Answer: C

Explanation: Using an IAM group is the best practice for managing permissions for multiple users with the same job function. You manage one policy for the group, and permissions are automatically inherited by all users in the group. This is more scalable and less error-prone than attaching policies to individual users (A). Sharing credentials (B) is a major security risk. Creating a role for each user (D) is unnecessary overhead; groups are designed for this use case.
---
Question #: 102
What is the fundamental difference between an identity-based policy and a resource-based policy in IAM?

A. Identity-based policies are written in XML, while resource-based policies are written in JSON.
B. Identity-based policies are attached to IAM identities (users, groups, roles), while resource-based policies are attached to resources (like S3 buckets).
C. Identity-based policies can only grant permissions, while resource-based policies can only deny permissions.
D. Only identity-based policies can be managed by AWS.

Answer: B

Explanation: This is the core distinction. Identity-based policies define what an identity can do. Resource-based policies are inline policies attached to a resource (e.g., an S3 bucket or an SQS queue) that specify which principals are allowed to perform actions on that specific resource. Both policy types are written in JSON (A), and both can grant or deny permissions (C). Both can be customer-managed (D).
---
Question #: 103
An IAM user has a policy attached that explicitly allows reading from an S3 bucket. The user is also a member of a group that has a policy attached explicitly denying all S3 actions. What is the effective permission for the user regarding the S3 bucket?

A. The user will be allowed to read from the S3 bucket.
B. The user will be denied all access to the S3 bucket.
C. The user will be prompted to choose which policy to apply.
D. The result is unpredictable and depends on the policy evaluation order.

Answer: B

Explanation: During IAM policy evaluation, an explicit "Deny" always overrides any "Allow". Since the user's group membership includes a policy that denies S3 access, this takes precedence over the user's individual policy that allows it. Therefore, the user will be denied access.
---
Question #: 104
A company needs to grant a third-party auditing firm temporary access to its AWS account to review logging configurations. The auditing firm has its own AWS account. What is the most secure method to provide this access?

A. Create IAM users for the auditors in your account and provide them with long-term access keys.
B. Create an IAM role with the necessary read-only permissions and establish a cross-account trust relationship with the auditor's AWS account.
C. Share your AWS account's root user credentials with the auditing firm.
D. Ask the auditors to create users in their account, and you create a corresponding set of users with matching names in your account.

Answer: B

Explanation: Cross-account role assumption is the designed and most secure method for this scenario. You create a role in your account that trusts the auditor's account ID. The auditors can then assume this role to get temporary credentials with limited permissions, without any long-term users or keys being created in your account. Option A creates long-term credentials which is less secure. Option C is a critical security breach. Option D is not a valid AWS access method.
---
Question #: 105
Which of the following are valid types of IAM policies? (Choose TWO)

A. AWS Managed Policies
B. Service-Linked Policies
C. Inline Policies
D. Account-Level Policies
E. Regional Policies

Answer: A, C

Explanation: AWS provides two main categories of policies you can use: Managed Policies (which include AWS Managed and Customer Managed) and Inline Policies. Managed policies are standalone and can be attached to multiple entities. Inline policies are embedded directly into a single user, group, or role. Service-Linked Policies (B) are a type of managed policy used by services, but "AWS Managed" and "Inline" are the primary user-facing types. D and E are not valid IAM policy types.
---
Question #: 106
What is the primary purpose of IAM roles?

A. To permanently assign permissions to a user.
B. To be a container for IAM users.
C. To be assumed by a trusted entity to obtain temporary security credentials.
D. To define the billing structure for an AWS account.

Answer: C

Explanation: The key feature of an IAM role is that it is not directly associated with a specific person. Instead, it is meant to be assumed by a trusted principal (like an EC2 instance, a Lambda function, a user, or another AWS account) to obtain temporary security credentials for a specific task. Groups are containers for users (B). Policies assign permissions (A). Billing is handled by AWS Billing and Cost Management (D).
---
Question #: 107
A solutions architect is creating an IAM policy and needs to ensure it only applies when requests come from a specific range of IP addresses. Which part of the IAM policy statement should be used?

A. Effect
B. Action
C. Resource
D. Condition

Answer: D

Explanation: The "Condition" block is used to specify circumstances under which a policy is in effect. To restrict access by IP address, you would use the "aws:SourceIp" condition key within the Condition element. The other elements define the effect (Allow/Deny), the action being performed, and the resource being acted upon.
---
Question #: 108
What does MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) provide for an AWS account?

A. It encrypts all data at rest in the AWS account.
B. It adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of authentication.
C. It automatically rotates IAM user access keys.
D. It restricts access to AWS services from specific geographic locations.

Answer: B

Explanation: MFA improves security by requiring users to provide something they know (password) and something they have (a code from a physical or virtual MFA device). This protects against compromised passwords. MFA does not handle encryption (A), key rotation (C), or geoblocking (D), although geoblocking can be achieved using condition keys in IAM policies.
---
Question #: 109
An IAM policy contains no explicit "Allow" statements but has one explicit "Deny" statement for Amazon S3 access. What is the outcome when a user with this policy tries to access S3?

A. Access is allowed because there is no explicit allow.
B. Access is denied because of the explicit deny statement.
C. Access is denied because all permissions are denied by default.
D. The policy is invalid and will cause an error.

Answer: B

Explanation: The IAM evaluation logic states that an explicit "Deny" always takes precedence. Even if there were an "Allow" statement elsewhere, the "Deny" would win. In this case, the explicit "Deny" is sufficient to block access. If there were no explicit deny, access would also be denied because of the default deny (C), but the presence of an explicit deny makes (B) the more precise answer.
---
Question #: 110
You are configuring an application on an EC2 instance that needs to call AWS services. Where does the EC2 instance get its security credentials when using an IAM role?

A. From a credentials file stored in /etc/aws/.
B. From environment variables pre-configured on the instance.
C. From the EC2 instance metadata service at 169.254.169.254.
D. The credentials must be passed to the instance at launch time using user data.

Answer: C

Explanation: When an EC2 instance is associated with an IAM role, the AWS SDKs and CLI on the instance automatically retrieve temporary credentials from the instance metadata service. This is a link-local address accessible only from the instance itself, making it a secure way to obtain credentials without hardcoding them.
---
Question #: 111
What is an IAM "permission boundary"?

A. A policy that defines the geographic boundaries from which a user can access AWS.
B. An advanced feature that uses a managed policy to set the maximum permissions an identity-based policy can grant to an IAM entity.
C. A resource-based policy that defines the boundary of an AWS service.
D. A special policy attached only to the root user to limit its capabilities.

Answer: B

Explanation: A permissions boundary is a mechanism for delegating permissions management. It sets a "boundary" or ceiling on the permissions that an IAM entity (user or role) can have. The entity's effective permissions are the intersection of its identity-based policies and its permissions boundary. It cannot perform actions that are not allowed by BOTH the identity policy and the boundary.
---
Question #: 112
An organization wants to ensure that an IAM user can rotate their own access keys but cannot manage keys for other users. Which AWS managed policy provides this functionality?

A. AdministratorAccess
B. IAMFullAccess
C. IAMUserChangePassword
D. IAMSelfManageAccessKeys
E. PowerUserAccess

Answer: D

Explanation: The IAMSelfManageAccessKeys managed policy allows a user to create, update, and delete their own access keys, but not manage access keys for other IAM users. This aligns with the principle of least privilege.
---
Question #: 113
Which IAM entity can be used to delegate access between AWS accounts?

A. IAM Group
B. IAM User
C. IAM Role
D. Inline Policy

Answer: C

Explanation: An IAM Role is the primary mechanism for delegating access. For cross-account access, you create a role in the target account and define the source account ID in the role's trust policy as a trusted principal. Users in the source account can then assume this role to access resources in the target account.
---
Question #: 114
What is the purpose of the `sts:AssumeRole` action in an IAM policy?

A. It allows the IAM entity to create new roles.
B. It allows the IAM entity to switch to (assume) an existing role.
C. It allows the IAM entity to delete roles.
D. It allows the IAM entity to modify the trust policy of a role.

Answer: B

Explanation: The `sts:AssumeRole` action is the specific permission required for a principal (user, application, etc.) to obtain temporary credentials by assuming an IAM role. The role being assumed must also have a trust policy that allows the principal to assume it.
---
Question #: 115
A company wants to allow its EC2 instances to upload logs to a specific CloudWatch Logs log group. What combination of IAM components is required? (Choose TWO)

A. An IAM user with CloudWatch Logs permissions.
B. An IAM policy granting `logs:PutLogEvents` permissions.
C. An IAM role for the EC2 instances to assume.
D. An IAM group containing the EC2 instances.
E. An MFA device attached to the EC2 instances.

Answer: B, C

Explanation: The standard and secure practice is to create an IAM role (C) that EC2 instances can assume. This role must have an attached IAM policy (B) that grants the necessary permissions, such as `logs:PutLogEvents`, to write to CloudWatch Logs. IAM users (A) are for people, not resources. EC2 instances cannot be put in IAM groups (D) or have MFA devices (E).
---
Question #: 116
You attach the following policy to an IAM user. What is the effect of this policy?
`{ "Version": "2012-10-17", "Statement": [{ "Effect": "Allow", "Action": "s3:GetObject", "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-secure-bucket/*" }] }`

A. The user can list all objects in the `my-secure-bucket`.
B. The user can download any object from the `my-secure-bucket`.
C. The user can upload objects to the `my-secure-bucket`.
D. The user has full administrative access to the `my-secure-bucket`.

Answer: B

Explanation: The `s3:GetObject` action specifically grants permission to retrieve, or download, objects. It does not grant permission to list objects (`s3:ListBucket`), upload objects (`s3:PutObject`), or perform any other administrative actions.
---
Question #: 117
An organization's security policy requires that all IAM users must change their own password and cannot change it more than once per day. How can a solutions architect enforce this?

A. Use AWS Config to monitor for password changes and revert them if they happen too frequently.
B. Set a password policy for the AWS account that specifies a minimum password age of one day.
C. Create an IAM policy with a condition that checks the time since the last password change.
D. This cannot be enforced in AWS IAM.

Answer: B

Explanation: AWS IAM allows you to set a comprehensive password policy for your account. This policy includes options for minimum password length, required character types, password expiration, preventing password reuse, and setting a minimum password age to prevent rapid changes.
---
Question #: 118
Which statement about the AWS account root user is correct?

A. It is best practice to use the root user for daily administrative tasks.
B. The root user credentials are the email address and password used to create the AWS account.
C. The root user cannot be protected by Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).
D. By default, the root user has no permissions and must be granted them via an IAM policy.

Answer: B

Explanation: The root user is the identity created when the AWS account is opened, and its credentials are the associated email and password. It is a best practice to NOT use the root user for daily tasks (A) but instead create an administrative IAM user. The root user should always be protected by MFA (C). The root user has full, unrestricted access to all resources in the account by default (D).
---
Question #: 119
An IAM policy has two statements. The first statement allows `s3:GetObject` on a bucket. The second statement denies `s3:*` on the same bucket if the request does not come from a specific VPC endpoint. A user subject to this policy tries to get an object from outside the VPC. What happens?

A. The request is allowed because the `Allow` statement is more specific.
B. The request is denied because the condition in the `Deny` statement is met.
C. The request is allowed because `Deny` statements with conditions are evaluated last.
D. The request fails with a policy evaluation error.

Answer: B

Explanation: The IAM evaluation logic first checks for any explicit `Deny` that matches the context of the request. The user's request is for an S3 action, and it comes from outside the specified VPC endpoint. Therefore, the condition in the `Deny` statement is met, the deny is applied, and the request is blocked. An explicit deny always overrides an allow.
---
Question #: 120
A solutions architect creates an IAM role for a Lambda function. What is this type of role called?

A. A cross-account role.
B. A service-linked role.
C. A service role.
D. An EC2 instance role.

Answer: C

Explanation: A service role is an IAM role that an AWS service assumes to perform actions on your behalf. In this case, the Lambda service assumes the role to get permissions to interact with other AWS services, like writing to a DynamoDB table or reading from an S3 bucket. A service-linked role is a special type of service role that is predefined by and linked to a specific service.
---
Question #: 121
What is the scope of an IAM user?

A. It is tied to a specific AWS Region.
B. It is tied to a specific Availability Zone.
C. It is global and not scoped to any Region.
D. It is tied to a specific VPC.

Answer: C

Explanation: IAM is a global service. IAM users, groups, roles, and policies that you create are not specific to any AWS Region. This means a user can log in and access resources in any region, subject to their permissions.
---
Question #: 122
A user reports they cannot access a newly created EC2 instance, receiving an "explicit deny" error. The user has the `AdministratorAccess` policy attached. What is the most likely cause?

A. The user's credentials have expired.
B. There is a Service Control Policy (SCP) in AWS Organizations that is denying the action.
C. The EC2 service is down in that region.
D. The `AdministratorAccess` policy does not include permissions for EC2.

Answer: B

Explanation: `AdministratorAccess` grants full access, so a direct policy shouldn't be the issue. An explicit deny means there is a `Deny` statement somewhere in the evaluation path. If the account is part of an AWS Organization, a Service Control Policy (SCP) attached to the account or an Organizational Unit (OU) can restrict permissions for all users, including the root user and administrators. This is a common source of "explicit deny" errors when direct policies seem correct.
---
Question #: 123
You need to provide a new IAM user with a pre-built set of permissions for read-only access to nearly all AWS services. What is the quickest way to achieve this?

A. Create a new custom policy listing read-only actions for every service.
B. Attach the AWS managed policy named `ReadOnlyAccess`.
C. Attach the AWS managed policy named `PowerUserAccess`.
D. Create an IAM role with read-only permissions and have the user assume it.

Answer: B

Explanation: AWS provides pre-built managed policies for common use cases. The `ReadOnlyAccess` policy is specifically designed to grant read-only permissions across a wide range of AWS services. This is much faster and less error-prone than creating a custom policy from scratch (A). `PowerUserAccess` (C) grants create, modify, and delete permissions, which is not what is required. A role (D) is unnecessary for a user who will always be using these permissions directly.
---
Question #: 124
When is it appropriate to use an IAM inline policy instead of a customer-managed policy?

A. When you want to apply the same set of permissions to multiple IAM users.
B. When you want to maintain a strict one-to-one relationship between a policy and the single entity it's applied to.
C. When you want AWS to automatically update the policy when new services are released.
D. When the policy exceeds the character limit for managed policies.

Answer: B

Explanation: Inline policies are best used when you want to be certain that the permissions in a policy are not inadvertently attached to any other user, group, or role. Because they are embedded in a single entity, they create a strict one-to-one relationship. For reusable permissions, managed policies are the correct choice (A). AWS updates AWS-managed policies, not customer-managed or inline policies (C). Inline policies have smaller character limits than managed policies (D).
---
Question #: 125
An application running on-premises needs to access AWS resources. What is the most secure method for providing AWS credentials to the application?

A. Create an IAM role for cross-account access and use AWS STS to assume the role.
B. Create an IAM user, generate long-term access keys, and securely distribute them to the on-premises application.
C. Use AWS IAM Roles Anywhere to issue temporary credentials to the on-premises servers.
D. Use the AWS account root user's credentials, as it has the necessary permissions.

Answer: C

Explanation: IAM Roles Anywhere is a service specifically designed for this use case. It allows workloads running outside of AWS, such as on-premises servers, to use their existing X.509 digital certificates to obtain temporary AWS credentials and assume IAM roles. This is more secure than using long-term IAM user access keys (B). Option A is for AWS account-to-account access. Option D is never a secure practice.
---
Question #: 126
Which of the following is NOT a component of an IAM policy statement?

A. Version
B. Effect
C. Action
D. Principal
E. Metadata

Answer: E

Explanation: A standard IAM policy statement includes `Version`, `Effect` (Allow/Deny), `Action` (the API call), `Resource`, and optionally `Condition`. The `Principal` element is required in resource-based policies and role trust policies but not in identity-based policies. `Metadata` is not a valid component of an IAM policy statement.
---
Question #: 127
A solutions architect needs to understand which services and actions an IAM user has accessed in the last 90 days. Which IAM tool should be used?

A. IAM Policy Simulator
B. IAM Roles Anywhere
C. IAM Access Advisor (Access History)
D. AWS Organizations Service Control Policies

Answer: C

Explanation: The IAM Access Advisor shows the service permissions granted to a user, role, or group and when those services were last accessed. This information is crucial for identifying unused permissions and refining policies to adhere to the principle of least privilege. The Policy Simulator (A) is for testing policies, not reviewing past activity.
---
Question #: 128
What is the function of a trust policy for an IAM role?

A. It specifies the permissions that the role grants to the entity that assumes it.
B. It defines which principals (users, accounts, services) are allowed to assume the role.
C. It lists the IAM users who are trusted to manage the role.
D. It encrypts the temporary credentials generated by the role.

Answer: B

Explanation: An IAM role has two policies attached. The permissions policy (or policies) defines what the role can DO. The trust policy defines who can ASSUME the role. The trust policy is a critical security component that ensures only trusted entities can use the role.
---
Question #: 129
A company's security team mandates that all data stored in a specific S3 bucket must be encrypted. They also want to control who can use the encryption keys. Which IAM condition key can be used in a bucket policy to enforce a specific AWS KMS key for S3 uploads?

A. `s3:x-amz-server-side-encryption`
B. `s3:x-amz-acl`
C. `kms:EncryptionContext`
D. `s3:x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id`

Answer: D

Explanation: To enforce server-side encryption with a specific KMS key, you can use a bucket policy that denies `s3:PutObject` requests if the condition is not met. The condition key `s3:x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id` allows you to check if the request header specifies your required KMS key ARN. Option A checks for the encryption type (e.g., AES256 or aws:kms) but not the specific key.
---
Question #: 130
What happens if you try to delete an IAM user that is associated with an active access key?

A. The IAM user is deleted, but the access key remains active.
B. The deletion fails, and AWS prompts you to delete the access key first.
C. The IAM user is deleted, and the access key is automatically deactivated.
D. This action is not possible from the AWS Management Console, only the CLI.

Answer: C

Explanation: While the AWS console may prompt you and require you to acknowledge associated resources, the underlying API behavior is that you cannot delete an IAM user without first deleting their associated resources, including access keys, signing certificates, and password. The correct procedure is to first deactivate/delete keys, remove from groups, detach policies, and then delete the user. A direct deletion attempt will fail if these resources exist. Let's refine the answer: The most accurate description is that the deletion will fail.
*Correction:* The most accurate answer is that the deletion operation will fail with an error message stating that the user has active resources that must be removed first. Option B is the closest description of this behavior.

Answer: B

Explanation: AWS prevents the deletion of an IAM user if they have associated items like access keys, policies, or group memberships. To delete the user, you must first detach any policies, remove the user from all groups, and delete their access keys, signing certificates, and password. The API will return a `DeleteConflict` error if you attempt to delete a user with these items attached.
---
Question #: 131
An IAM policy contains the following statement. What does the wildcard `*` signify in the "Action" element?
`"Action": "ec2:Describe*"`

A. It grants permission to all actions in all AWS services.
B. It grants permission to all EC2 actions that begin with the prefix "Describe".
C. It grants permission only to the `ec2:DescribeInstances` action.
D. It signifies that the action applies to all resources in the account.

Answer: B

Explanation: The wildcard `*` can be used to match multiple characters. In an IAM policy's "Action" element, `ec2:Describe*` serves as a prefix match, granting permissions for all EC2 actions that start with "Describe", such as `ec2:DescribeInstances`, `ec2:DescribeVolumes`, and `ec2:DescribeSubnets`.
---
Question #: 132
A company wants to allow federated users from its corporate Active Directory to access the AWS Management Console. Which AWS service facilitates this?

A. AWS IAM Roles Anywhere
B. AWS Directory Service
C. AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) using SAML 2.0 or OpenID Connect
D. Amazon Cognito

Answer: C

Explanation: IAM supports identity federation, allowing you to use an external identity provider (IdP), like Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS), that supports SAML 2.0. The IdP authenticates the user and passes an assertion to AWS STS, which then provides temporary credentials for the user to access AWS, often by assuming a role. While Cognito (D) can also be used for federation, direct IAM federation with SAML is the most direct answer for this specific use case.
---
Question #: 133
What is the best practice for securing the root user of an AWS account? (Choose TWO)

A. Use the root user for all automated scripts.
B. Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) on the root user.
C. Store the root user's access keys in a secure, encrypted S3 bucket.
D. Delete the root user's access keys if they are not needed.
E. Share the root user password with all administrators.

Answer: B, D

Explanation: The root user is the most privileged identity in the account. Best practices are to (B) enable MFA and (D) delete its access keys to prevent programmatic access. The root user password should be stored securely and used only for tasks that require root privileges. It should never be used for scripts (A), its keys should not be created or stored if not needed (C), and its password should never be shared (E).
---
Question #: 134
An IAM user is part of a group that allows `ec2:StartInstances`. A permissions boundary attached to the user allows `ec2:StopInstances`. What can the user do?

A. The user can start and stop instances.
B. The user can only start instances.
C. The user can only stop instances.
D. The user cannot start or stop instances.

Answer: D

Explanation: The effective permissions of an IAM entity are the intersection (the common permissions) of its identity-based policies and its permissions boundary. In this case, the identity policy allows `Start` and the boundary allows `Stop`. Since there is no overlap, the user has no permissions to perform either action.
---
Question #: 135
How can you test an IAM policy before applying it to users or roles in a production environment?

A. By using the IAM Access Advisor.
B. By using the IAM Policy Simulator.
C. By attaching it to a test user and observing the CloudTrail logs.
D. By using AWS Trusted Advisor.

Answer: B

Explanation: The IAM Policy Simulator is a tool specifically designed to help you test and troubleshoot IAM policies. You can select an entity (user, group, role), the policy to test, and the action to perform on a specific resource to see whether the policy would allow or deny the action in practice.
---
Question #: 136
What is a Service Control Policy (SCP)?

A. A policy used by an AWS service to access resources in a customer's account.
B. A type of identity-based policy that controls access to specific services.
C. A policy used in AWS Organizations to manage permissions and enforce guardrails across member accounts.
D. A policy that controls network traffic to and from AWS services.

Answer: C

Explanation: Service Control Policies (SCPs) are a feature of AWS Organizations. They offer central control over the maximum available permissions for all IAM entities in an account. SCPs act as a filter; even if an administrator grants `s3:*` in an account, if the SCP denies S3 access, no user or role in that account can use S3.

Question #: 137
An application running in a VPC needs to access Amazon S3 securely without traversing the public internet. Which IAM feature, in conjunction with VPC features, enables this?

A. An IAM role with a trust policy allowing the VPC.
B. A resource-based policy on the S3 bucket.
C. A VPC Endpoint for S3.
D. A NAT Gateway.

Answer: C

Explanation: While IAM controls the permissions, the network path is controlled by VPC features. A VPC Endpoint for S3 allows resources within your VPC to communicate with S3 using private IP addresses. You can then use bucket policies (a type of resource-based policy) to restrict access, allowing requests only from that specific VPC endpoint, but the endpoint itself is the key network component. A NAT Gateway (D) provides outbound internet access, which is the opposite of what is needed.

Question #: 138
Which of the following credentials can be used for programmatic access to AWS? (Choose TWO)

A. Password
B. Access Key ID and Secret Access Key
C. MFA Code
D. X.509 Certificate
E. Key Pair (.pem file)

Answer: B, D

Explanation: Programmatic access (using the CLI, SDKs, or API) is primarily authenticated using an Access Key ID and Secret Access Key (B). For some older services like the SOAP API for S3, an X.509 certificate (D) can also be used. A password (A) is for console access. An MFA code (C) is a second factor, not a primary credential. A Key Pair (E) is used for SSH access to EC2 instances, not for authenticating to AWS APIs.
---
Question #: 139
A company has a policy that passwords for IAM users must be rotated every 90 days. A new user is created, but the console is not forcing a password reset on their first login. What could be the issue?

A. The "Require password reset" option was not enabled in the account's password policy.
B. The user was created using the AWS CLI instead of the Management Console.
C. The user was not assigned an MFA device upon creation.
D. The password policy has an option like "Allow users to change their own password" unchecked.

Answer: A

Explanation: In the IAM account password policy settings, there is a specific checkbox for "Require administrators to set a temporary password that the user must change on first sign-in." If this is not enabled, users created with a console-generated or admin-set password will not be forced to change it. While (D) is a required permission, the enforcement of a first-login reset is a separate setting in the password policy itself.
---
Question #: 140
You are writing an IAM policy to grant access to a specific folder within an S3 bucket named `my-company-docs`. The folder is named `public-reports`. Which ARN format is correct for the `Resource` element?

A. `arn:aws:s3:::my-company-docs`
B. `arn:aws:s3:::my-company-docs/*`
C. `arn:aws:s3:::my-company-docs/public-reports/*`
D. `arn:aws:s3:::my-company-docs/public-reports`

Answer: C

Explanation: To grant permissions to the objects *within* a folder, you must specify the bucket name, the folder path, and add a `/*` at the end. This `/*` wildcard indicates that the policy applies to all objects inside the `public-reports` folder. Option D would refer to an object literally named "public-reports", not the contents of a folder. Option B would apply to all objects in the bucket, not just that folder.
---
Question #: 141
When you create an IAM role, what must you define?

A. The permissions policy and the users who can assume the role.
B. The trust policy and the permissions policy.
C. The trust policy and the groups the role belongs to.
D. The permissions policy and the MFA requirements for the role.

Answer: B

Explanation: Creating an IAM role requires two distinct policies. The trust policy specifies which principals (accounts, users, services, etc.) are allowed to assume the role. The permissions policy (or policies) specifies what actions the entity assuming the role is allowed to perform.
---
Question #: 142
A policy is needed to allow an EC2 instance to read messages from an SQS queue. Which combination of principal and resource is correct in the respective IAM policies?

A. Principal: The EC2 instance ARN in the SQS queue policy. Resource: The SQS queue ARN in the EC2 role's permission policy.
B. Principal: The EC2 service in the SQS queue policy. Resource: The EC2 instance ARN in the role's permission policy.
C. Principal: The IAM user who launched the instance. Resource: The SQS queue ARN.
D. Principal: Not needed in the EC2 role. Resource: Not needed in the SQS queue policy.

Answer: A

Explanation: Access can be granted in two ways: identity-based or resource-based. For the identity-based approach, the EC2 instance's role needs a permission policy where the `Resource` is the SQS queue's ARN. For the resource-based approach, the SQS queue's access policy needs a statement where the `Principal` is the ARN of the IAM role attached to the EC2 instance. Option A correctly describes both sides of this relationship.
---
Question #: 143
What is the most significant security risk of not rotating IAM access keys regularly?

A. The keys might become incompatible with new AWS services.
B. The performance of API calls using the keys may degrade over time.
C. If a key is compromised, it provides a longer window of opportunity for an attacker to use it.
D. AWS automatically deletes keys that are older than two years.

Answer: C

Explanation: The primary reason for rotating keys is to limit the potential damage if they are ever compromised (e.g., accidentally checked into a public code repository). By rotating them, you ensure that any leaked key will only be valid for a limited time. AWS does not delete old keys (D). Performance (B) and compatibility (A) are not related to key age.
---
Question #: 144
A company uses AWS Organizations and has a Service Control Policy (SCP) that denies access to the `iam:CreateUser` action. An administrator in a member account, who has the `AdministratorAccess` policy, attempts to create a new IAM user. What will happen?

A. The user will be created successfully because `AdministratorAccess` includes this permission.
B. The action will fail because the SCP takes precedence and creates an explicit deny.
C. The administrator will be prompted to override the SCP.
D. The action will succeed, but a security alert will be sent to the master account.

Answer: B

Explanation: SCPs act as guardrails for accounts within an organization. They do not grant permissions but rather set the maximum permissions available. An explicit deny in an SCP will override any allow in an IAM policy within a member account. The administrator's action will be denied.
---
Question #: 145
Which AWS service allows you to create and manage a directory in the cloud and connect AWS resources to your on-premises Active Directory?

A. Amazon Cognito
B. AWS IAM
C. AWS Directory Service
D. AWS Organizations

Answer: C

Explanation: AWS Directory Service provides multiple ways to use Microsoft Active Directory with other AWS services. This includes creating a managed AD in the cloud or using AD Connector to proxy directory requests to your on-premises AD without caching information in the cloud.
---
Question #: 146
An IAM policy grants `Allow` for `ec2:StartInstances` and `ec2:StopInstances` for the resource `"*"`. What is the impact of the `Resource: "*"` element?

A. The user can start and stop EC2 instances in any AWS region.
B. The user can start and stop any resource in the AWS account, not just EC2 instances.
C. The user can start and stop any EC2 instance within the AWS account.
D. The policy is invalid because `"*"` is not a valid resource for EC2 actions.

Answer: C

Explanation: The `Resource: "*"` in an IAM policy means the action applies to all resources *that the action supports*. Since the actions are `ec2:StartInstances` and `ec2:StopInstances`, this policy allows the user to perform these actions on any and all EC2 instances in the account. While IAM is global, the policy applies to instances in any region the user operates in, but the most precise answer is that it applies to any EC2 instance resource (C).
---
Question #: 147
What is a primary use case for Amazon Cognito?

A. Managing permissions for AWS services and resources.
B. Providing identity management for web and mobile applications, including sign-up, sign-in, and access control.
C. Federating access for corporate users into the AWS Management Console.
D. Auditing IAM user activity across an AWS organization.

Answer: B

Explanation: Amazon Cognito is primarily a service for developers to add user sign-up, sign-in, and access control to their web and mobile applications. It provides user pools for authentication and identity pools for authorization (granting temporary AWS credentials). IAM (A, C) manages permissions within AWS itself. CloudTrail (D) audits user activity.
---
Question #: 148
Which CLI command would you use to see if a specific IAM policy would allow or deny a given action, without actually performing the action?

A. `aws iam check-policy`
B. `aws iam simulate-principal-policy`
C. `aws iam get-policy-permission`
D. `aws iam validate-policy`

Answer: B

Explanation: The `aws iam simulate-principal-policy` command is the CLI equivalent of the IAM Policy Simulator. It allows you to test a policy against a list of actions and resources to determine the resulting "allow" or "deny" decision.
---
Question #: 149
A company wants to give a user the ability to pass a role to an EC2 instance at launch. What specific IAM permission is required for this?

A. `ec2:RunInstances`
B. `iam:CreateRole`
C. `iam:PassRole`
D. `ec2:AssociateIamInstanceProfile`

Answer: C

Explanation: The `iam:PassRole` permission is a security control that allows a user to pass an existing IAM role to an AWS service like EC2. This is a separate and required permission in addition to `ec2:RunInstances`, to prevent users from assigning roles with more permissions than they themselves have, which would be a privilege escalation.
---
Question #: 150
What is the main difference between an IAM user and an IAM role?

A. A user has permanent credentials, while a role has temporary credentials.
B. A role can belong to a group, but a user cannot.
C. A user is global, while a role is regional.
D. A role must be associated with an MFA device, but a user does not.

Answer: A

Explanation: The defining difference is that an IAM user has long-term credentials (password, access keys) associated with it. An IAM role has no credentials of its own; it is an entity that is assumed, and upon assumption, it provides short-term, temporary credentials that expire. Both users and roles are global (C). Users can belong to groups, roles cannot (B). MFA can be required for both (D).
---
Question #: 151
A resource-based policy is attached to an S3 bucket. It grants access to an IAM user in another AWS account. The IAM user does not have any identity-based policies allowing S3 access. Can the user access the bucket?

A. No, access is denied because the user has no identity-based policy allowing it.
B. Yes, if a resource-based policy in another account grants access, no identity-based policy is needed in the user's home account.
C. No, cross-account access is only possible using IAM roles.
D. Yes, but only if the user first assumes a role in the target account.

Answer: B

Explanation: For cross-account access, permissions must be granted by BOTH the identity policy in the source account AND the resource policy in the destination account. However, there is an exception: if the resource-based policy in the destination account explicitly grants access to a principal (user or role) in another account, that principal does NOT need an identity-based policy in its own account to allow the action. The resource policy is sufficient.

*Correction:* The standard rule for cross-account access (excluding roles) is that permissions must exist on both sides. Let's re-verify this nuance. From AWS Docs: "For cross-account access, you must use an IAM role. A resource-based policy can grant a user in another account access to the resource. In that case, the user's administrator must also grant the user permission to access the resource." This means both are required. Therefore, the original answer is incorrect.

Answer: A

Explanation: For cross-account access between principals that are not using a role, permissions must be granted on both sides. The resource-based policy in the target account must grant access to the user, AND the user's identity-based policies in their home account must also grant them permission to perform the action on the target resource. Since the user has no such identity-based policy, access will be denied.
---
Question #: 152
You are creating a custom IAM policy. You want to deny all actions except for a few specific ones related to S3 and EC2. What is the best way to structure this policy statement?

A. Use `"Effect": "Allow"` and list all S3 and EC2 actions.
B. Use `"Effect": "Deny"`, `"Action": "*:*"` and then use a `Condition` to exclude the S3 and EC2 actions.
C. Use `"Effect": "Deny"` and use the `"NotAction"` element to specify the S3 and EC2 actions that should be allowed.
D. Create two policies: one to deny all actions and one to allow the S3 and EC2 actions.

Answer: C

Explanation: The `NotAction` element, when combined with `"Effect": "Deny"`, creates a statement that denies everything *except* for the actions listed in `NotAction`. This is a powerful way to create a security boundary, ensuring that the user can ONLY perform the specified actions and nothing else. This is more explicit and secure than a broad "Allow" statement.
---
Question #: 153
An IAM policy contains a variable like `${aws:username}`. What is the purpose of this variable?

A. It is a placeholder that gets replaced by the IAM username of the user making the request.
B. It is a tag that can be used for cost allocation.
C. It is a condition key that restricts access based on the user's name.
D. It is a variable that can only be used in role trust policies.

Answer: A

Explanation: IAM policy variables allow you to create general policies that are customized at the time of evaluation. The `${aws:username}` variable is replaced with the friendly name of the current IAM user. This is useful for creating self-service policies, for example, allowing users to manage resources only in an S3 "home" folder that matches their username (`s3:::my-bucket/home/${aws:username}/*`).
---
Question #: 154
Which AWS service provides a formal way to request, track, and manage access to AWS accounts by providing time-bound, least-privilege permissions for your workforce?

A. AWS IAM
B. AWS Directory Service
C. AWS IAM Identity Center (Successor to AWS SSO)
D. AWS Organizations

Answer: C

Explanation: AWS IAM Identity Center is the recommended service for managing workforce access to AWS accounts and applications. It allows you to connect to an identity provider (like Azure AD, Okta, or its own internal directory) and then centrally manage "permission sets" that can be assigned to users or groups for specific accounts, with time-bound sessions. This simplifies access management at scale compared to managing IAM users in every account.
---
Question #: 155
Which of the following is a valid IAM security best practice?

A. Create a single, powerful IAM user and share its credentials among the operations team.
B. Attach policies directly to IAM users instead of using groups.
C. Grant the least privilege necessary for a user to perform their required tasks.
D. Always keep the root user's access keys active for emergency situations.

Answer: C

Explanation: The principle of least privilege is a fundamental security concept in IAM and cybersecurity in general. It means granting only the permissions that are absolutely required for a user, application, or service to perform its function, and no more. This minimizes the potential damage from errors or compromise. Sharing credentials (A), attaching policies to users instead of groups (B), and keeping root keys active (D) are all anti-patterns.
---
Question #: 156
An S3 bucket policy explicitly allows access to an IAM role `arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/MyRole`. An SCP applied to the account `111122223333` explicitly denies all S3 access. What is the result when `MyRole` tries to access the bucket?

A. Access is allowed because a resource-based policy takes precedence over an SCP.
B. Access is denied because the SCP acts as a guardrail that overrides account-level permissions.
C. Access is allowed, but an audit finding will be logged in AWS Security Hub.
D. The role will be unable to be assumed because of the SCP conflict.

Answer: B

Explanation: The AWS Organizations SCP evaluation logic is applied before any account-level IAM policies. An explicit deny in an SCP will prevent the action, regardless of what IAM permissions (identity-based or resource-based) are configured within the account. The role can still be assumed, but it will be unable to perform the denied S3 actions.
---
Question #: 157
A developer wants to give a Lambda function permission to write objects to an S3 bucket. What is the first step the developer should take?

A. Hardcode an IAM user's access key into the Lambda function's code.
B. Create an IAM role for the Lambda function with an appropriate permissions policy.
C. Configure the S3 bucket to allow anonymous public write access.
D. Create an IAM user for the Lambda function.

Answer: B

Explanation: AWS services like Lambda are designed to use IAM roles (specifically, service roles) for permissions. The best practice is to create a role with a policy granting `s3:PutObject` permission and assign it as the function's execution role. This provides temporary, automatically managed credentials to the function. Hardcoding keys (A) is insecure. Public access (C) is insecure and incorrect. IAM users (D) are for people or long-term application credentials, not for services like Lambda.
---
Question #: 158
How can you get a report of all IAM users in your account along with the status of their credentials (password, access keys, MFA)?

A. By generating a credential report from the IAM console.
B. By parsing the output of the `aws iam list-users` CLI command.
C. By reviewing CloudTrail logs for login events.
D. By creating a custom script to query the IAM API for each user individually.

Answer: A

Explanation: The IAM credential report is a downloadable CSV file that lists all users in your account and details the status of their various credentials, including password last used, access key last used, MFA status, and more. It is the most direct and comprehensive way to get this information for auditing purposes.
---
Question #: 159
You need to grant an IAM user permissions to manage only their own access keys and password. Which AWS managed policy should you use?

A. `IAMFullAccess`
B. `PowerUserAccess`
C. `IAMUserChangePassword`
D. `IAMSelfManageServiceSpecificCredentials`

Answer: C

Explanation: The `IAMUserChangePassword` policy grants only the permissions necessary for a user to change their own console password. To manage their own access keys, they would need additional permissions like `iam:CreateAccessKey`, `iam:DeleteAccessKey`, and `iam:UpdateAccessKey`. Of the options provided, (C) is the closest, though it only covers passwords. A custom policy is usually best for this. Let's re-examine the options. There is no single managed policy for this. `IAMUserChangePassword` is only for the password. The correct way is a custom policy. If we assume the question implies there is a managed policy for this, we need to find the best fit. Let's assume the question is flawed and focus on the most restrictive, relevant policy.

*Correction*: A more specific policy exists. `IAMUserChangePassword` is just for the password. A better approach involves other permissions. A more precise managed policy might be available or a custom policy is needed. Let's review managed policies again. There is no single AWS managed policy that combines just self-password-change and self-key-management. Therefore, a custom policy is required. Let's rephrase the answer to reflect this.

Answer: C (with clarification)

Explanation: Of the choices given, `IAMUserChangePassword` is the managed policy that allows a user to change their own password. However, it does NOT grant permissions to manage their own access keys. The ideal solution would be to create a custom policy containing `iam:ChangePassword`, `iam:CreateAccessKey`, `iam:DeleteAccessKey`, etc., with a condition that the resource (`"Resource": "arn:aws:iam::*:user/${aws:username}"`) matches the current user.
---
Question #: 160
What information is contained within an IAM role's trust policy?

A. The ARN of the resources the role is allowed to access.
B. The list of API actions the role is allowed to perform.
C. The principal that is allowed to assume the role.
D. The date and time when the role's temporary credentials will expire.

Answer: C

Explanation: The trust policy's sole purpose is to define *who* (which principal - account, user, service, etc.) can assume the role. The permissions - what the role can do - are defined in the separate permissions policy(ies) attached to the role.
---
Question #: 161
An organization has hundreds of AWS accounts managed with AWS Organizations. They need to ensure that no user in any member account can ever disable AWS CloudTrail. How can this be enforced centrally?

A. By applying an IAM policy to an administrative role in each account.
B. By creating an AWS Config rule to detect when CloudTrail is disabled.
C. By applying a Service Control Policy (SCP) at the organization's root that denies the `cloudtrail:StopLogging` action.
D. By using AWS Trusted Advisor to monitor CloudTrail status.

Answer: C

Explanation: A Service Control Policy (SCP) is the only way to create a preventative guardrail that applies to all users and roles (including root) in an account. By attaching an SCP with an explicit deny for actions like `cloudtrail:StopLogging` and `cloudtrail:DeleteTrail` to the organization root or an OU, you can centrally enforce that these actions can never be taken in the member accounts.
---
Question #: 162
Which of the following are valid principals in an IAM policy? (Choose TWO)

A. An AWS Service (e.g., `ec2.amazonaws.com`)
B. An AWS Region (e.g., `us-east-1`)
C. An AWS Account ID or ARN
D. A specific IP Address
E. An IAM Group

Answer: A, C

Explanation: The `Principal` element specifies the user, account, service, or other entity that is allowed or denied access. Valid principals include an AWS account ARN (or just the ID), an IAM user ARN, an IAM role ARN, and an AWS service principal like `ec2.amazonaws.com` or `lambda.amazonaws.com`. IAM Groups (E) are not principals; you cannot grant permissions to a group in a resource-based policy. IP addresses (D) are used in Condition elements, not as principals. Regions (B) are not principals.
---
Question #: 163
A solutions architect is designing a system where an application on EC2 needs to access a DynamoDB table. To adhere to the principle of least privilege, how should the IAM policy be configured?

A. Allow all DynamoDB actions (`dynamodb:*`) on all tables (`"*"`).
B. Allow only the required actions (e.g., `dynamodb:PutItem`, `dynamodb:GetItem`) on the specific table's ARN.
C. Create an IAM user with the `AmazonDynamoDBFullAccess` managed policy and store the keys on the EC2 instance.
D. Allow all actions (`"*:*"`) on all resources (`"*"`).

Answer: B

Explanation: The principle of least privilege requires granting only the necessary permissions on only the necessary resources. Option B is the only one that follows this principle by specifying the exact actions needed (`PutItem`, `GetItem`) and scoping the resource down to the specific DynamoDB table's ARN. All other options are overly permissive.
---
Question #: 164
What is the function of the AWS Security Token Service (STS)?

A. To store and rotate secrets used by applications.
B. To create and provide trusted users with temporary security credentials.
C. To scan IAM policies for security vulnerabilities.
D. To centrally manage single sign-on access to multiple AWS accounts.

Answer: B

Explanation: AWS STS is a web service that enables you to request temporary, limited-privilege credentials for IAM users or for users that you authenticate (federated users). Key API calls include `AssumeRole`, `GetFederationToken`, and `GetSessionToken`, all of which provide temporary credentials.
---
Question #: 165
You are trying to attach a 7,000-character managed IAM policy to a user but receive an error. What is the most likely cause?

A. IAM policies must be written in YAML, not JSON.
B. The maximum size for a customer-managed policy is 6,144 characters.
C. The user already has the maximum number of 10 policies attached.
D. The policy contains an invalid action that does not exist.

Answer: B

Explanation: AWS has size limits for IAM entities. The maximum character size for a customer-managed policy is 6,144 characters. For inline policies, the limit is smaller. Since 7,000 exceeds this limit, the request would fail. The limit on the number of policies attached to a user is indeed 10 (C), but the size is the more direct cause given the information.
---
Question #: 166
A new IAM user is created with no policies attached and is not part of any groups. What can this user do?

A. The user has read-only access to all AWS services by default.
B. The user has administrative access by default.
C. The user can do nothing; all actions are implicitly denied by default.
D. The user can only change their own password.

Answer: C

Explanation: By default, a new IAM user has no permissions. All AWS actions are implicitly denied until they are explicitly allowed by an attached identity-based policy (or a resource-based policy).
---
Question #: 167
What is the purpose of an instance profile when launching an EC2 instance?

A. To define the CPU and memory characteristics of the instance.
B. To act as a container for an IAM role that the instance can use.
C. To specify the SSH key pair for logging into the instance.
D. To attach a pre-configured security group to the instance.

Answer: B

Explanation: An instance profile is a container for an IAM role that you can use to pass role information to an EC2 instance when the instance starts. The instance can then retrieve temporary credentials from the metadata service to interact with other AWS services as defined by the role's permissions.
---
Question #: 168
Your company has a "break-glass" administrative user for emergencies. To ensure it is only used when necessary, you want to be notified every time this user logs in. What is the best way to achieve this?

A. Use the IAM credential report to check for logins daily.
B. Create a CloudWatch Alarm that triggers on a specific CloudTrail event and sends an SNS notification.
C. Configure the IAM user's policy to send an email upon login.
D. Use AWS Trusted Advisor to monitor high-privilege user activity.

Answer: B

Explanation: This is a classic event-driven security monitoring pattern. AWS CloudTrail captures console logins as an event (e.g., `ConsoleLogin`). You can create a CloudWatch Events/EventBridge rule that matches this specific event for that specific user's ARN. The rule's target can be an SNS topic, which then sends an email or SMS notification to your security team.
---
Question #: 169
What is the difference between AWS IAM Identity Center (SSO) and IAM Federation with SAML?

A. IAM Federation can only be used with Microsoft Active Directory.
B. IAM Identity Center provides a user portal and centralizes management of permissions across many accounts.
C. IAM Identity Center uses permanent access keys, while Federation uses temporary ones.
D. There is no difference; they are two names for the same service.

Answer: B

Explanation: While both use federation, IAM Identity Center is a higher-level, managed service. It simplifies the process by providing a user portal (where users can see and select the accounts/roles they have access to) and a centralized place to manage "permission sets" and their assignment to users/groups across your entire AWS Organization. Standard IAM Federation requires more manual configuration of roles and trust policies in each account.
---
Question #: 170
An IAM policy allows an action. A permissions boundary on the same user also allows the action. A resource-based policy on the target S3 bucket denies the action. What is the result?

A. Allowed, because the identity policy and boundary both allow it.
B. Denied, because a resource-based policy's explicit deny is evaluated.
C. Allowed, because identity policies override resource policies.
D. The outcome depends on which policy was created last.

Answer: B

Explanation: The final decision to allow or deny is based on the evaluation of all applicable policies, including identity, resource, and organization policies. An explicit deny from any of these policy types will always override any allows. In this case, the explicit deny in the S3 bucket policy will cause the request to be denied.
---
Question #: 171
Which IAM entity is best suited for assigning a set of permissions to a collection of IAM users?

A. An IAM Role
B. An IAM Policy
C. An IAM Group
D. An IAM Principal

Answer: C

Explanation: An IAM Group is a container for IAM users. Its purpose is to simplify permission management. You can attach a policy to the group, and all users within that group will inherit those permissions. This is more efficient than attaching the same policy to many individual users.
---
Question #: 172
A company wants to prevent any IAM user or role in an account from launching EC2 instances larger than `t2.large`. How can this be enforced?

A. Create an IAM policy with a `Deny` effect and a `Condition` on the `ec2:InstanceType` key.
B. Use AWS Budgets to send an alert when a large instance is launched.
C. Configure the VPC to only allow `t2.large` instances.
D. This can only be controlled using Service Control Policies (SCPs).

Answer: A

Explanation: This can be enforced with an identity-based policy. You can create a policy that denies the `ec2:RunInstances` action if the `ec2:InstanceType` condition key does not match `t2.micro`, `t2.small`, `t2.medium`, or `t2.large`. This policy can then be attached to all non-admin users/groups or, more powerfully, used in a permissions boundary. An SCP could also do this at an organizational level (D), but it can be done with a standard IAM policy as well (A).
---
Question #: 173
What is the AWS recommended best practice for the initial setup of a new AWS account?

A. Immediately create access keys for the root user for programmatic access.
B. Create a powerful IAM role and delete the root user.
C. Create an individual IAM user with administrator privileges, enable MFA on the root user, and stop using the root user.
D. Share the root user credentials with the trusted members of your IT team.

Answer: C

Explanation: The standard AWS best practice is to secure the root user with MFA and then create a separate IAM user for day-to-day administrative tasks. The root user should only be used for a very small number of tasks that specifically require it (like changing account settings or closing the account).
---
Question #: 174
A user's permissions are derived from a user policy, a group policy, and a resource policy. Which policies are evaluated to determine the final permission?

A. Only the user policy is used.
B. Only the user policy and the group policy are used.
C. Only the most restrictive policy is used.
D. All applicable policies are evaluated together.

Answer: D

Explanation: AWS IAM evaluates all applicable policies, including identity-based policies (attached to the user and any groups they are in) and any resource-based policies (attached to the resource being requested). The logic combines these, with an explicit deny in any policy overriding all allows.
---
Question #: 175
What is the purpose of the `Version` element in an IAM policy document, e.g., `"Version": "2012-10-17"`?

A. It tracks the version of the specific policy, incrementing with each change.
B. It specifies the IAM policy language version, which defines the features and syntax that can be used.
C. It indicates the AWS SDK version required to interpret the policy.
D. It is an optional comment field for the administrator.

Answer: B

Explanation: The `Version` element specifies the version of the policy language. It is not a version number for your specific policy document. The latest version is `"2012-10-17"`, which introduced features like policy variables. Older policies might use `"2008-10-17"`. It is a required element.

Question #: 176
Which of the following is an example of an AWS managed policy?

A. A policy you create to grant specific DynamoDB access to your developers.
B. `AdministratorAccess`
C. A policy that is embedded directly into an IAM user.
D. A policy that trusts another AWS account.

Answer: B

Explanation: An AWS managed policy is a standalone policy that is created and managed by AWS. Examples include `AdministratorAccess`, `PowerUserAccess`, and `ReadOnlyAccess`. A policy you create (A) is a customer-managed policy. An embedded policy (C) is an inline policy. A trust policy (D) is a specific type of policy attached to a role.
---
Question #: 177
You need to ensure that when a user assumes a specific role, they are also required to use MFA. Where do you configure this requirement?

A. In the user's identity-based policy.
B. In the role's permissions policy.
C. In the account's password policy.
D. In the role's trust policy (assume role policy).

Answer: D

Explanation: To enforce MFA for role assumption, you add a `Condition` block to the role's trust policy. The condition checks if `"aws:MultiFactorAuthPresent": "true"`. This ensures that the `sts:AssumeRole` call will only succeed if the originating user's session was authenticated with MFA.
---
Question #: 178
An EC2 instance needs to be able to describe other EC2 instances and also stop a specific, tagged instance. Which two actions should be included in its IAM role's policy? (Choose TWO)

A. `ec2:DescribeInstances`
B. `ec2:TerminateInstances`
C. `ec2:StopInstances`
D. `ec2:ModifyInstanceAttribute`
E. `iam:PassRole`

Answer: A, C

Explanation: The permissions map directly to the API calls. `ec2:DescribeInstances` is required to list and view details of instances. `ec2:StopInstances` is required to stop an instance. You would then use a `Condition` element in the policy statement for `ec2:StopInstances` to limit this permission to instances with a specific tag.
---
Question #: 179
A company uses a resource-based policy on an SQS queue to grant `sqs:SendMessage` permission to an IAM role. What happens if the IAM role's permissions policy does not also grant this permission?

A. The message will be sent successfully because the resource-based policy is sufficient.
B. The action will fail because intra-account access requires permissions on both the identity and the resource.
C. The message will be sent, but it will be placed in the dead-letter queue.
D. The action will fail with an "Invalid Principal" error.

Answer: A

Explanation: For actions within the same AWS account, if either the identity-based policy OR the resource-based policy allows the action (and there is no explicit deny), the action is allowed. The permissions are not strictly required on both sides as they are for cross-account access. Since the queue's policy allows it, the role can send the message.
---
Question #: 180
Which IAM feature allows you to define a set of permissions and then use it as a template for creating new IAM roles and users with a predefined set of capabilities?

A. IAM Groups
B. AWS Managed Policies
C. IAM Permissions Boundaries
D. AWS IAM Identity Center Permission Sets

Answer: D

Explanation: In IAM Identity Center (formerly AWS SSO), a Permission Set is a template for permissions. You define a set of permissions (using inline policies or by attaching AWS managed policies), and then you can grant users and groups access to AWS accounts using that permission set. This is a key feature for managing access at scale.
---
Question #: 181
An application must be able to create its own IAM access keys. What permission must be granted to its IAM user/role?

A. `iam:CreateLoginProfile`
B. `iam:GenerateCredentialReport`
C. `iam:CreateAccessKey`
D. `sts:GetSessionToken`

Answer: C

Explanation: The `iam:CreateAccessKey` permission directly allows a principal to create a new access key ID and secret access key for a specified IAM user. This is a highly privileged permission and should be granted with extreme caution.
---
Question #: 182
A policy grants a user permission to terminate EC2 instances, but only if the instance has a tag `Department` with the value `Test`. Which policy element is used to check for the tag?

A. `Principal`
B. `Action`
C. `Condition`
D. `Resource`

Answer: C

Explanation: The `Condition` element is used to enforce criteria for when a policy is valid. To check for tags, you use condition keys like `aws:ResourceTag/tag-key`. In this case, the condition would be `StringEquals: {"aws:ResourceTag/Department": "Test"}`.
---
Question #: 183
Which of the following credentials has the longest lifetime by default?

A. Credentials from an EC2 instance profile role.
B. Credentials from assuming a role via the `sts:AssumeRole` API call.
C. An IAM user's access key.
D. Credentials from an IAM Identity Center (SSO) session.

Answer: C

Explanation: An IAM user's access key is a long-term credential; it is valid forever until it is manually rotated or deactivated. Credentials from STS (A, B) and Identity Center (D) are temporary by design and expire, typically after one hour by default, though this can be extended up to 12 hours for roles.
---
Question #: 184
You need to provide access to an S3 bucket for a large number of users authenticated through your company's mobile app. You do not want to create an IAM user for each app user. Which service is designed for this scenario?

A. AWS IAM
B. Amazon Cognito
C. AWS Directory Service
D. IAM Roles Anywhere

Answer: B

Explanation: Amazon Cognito is the ideal service for this use case. It allows you to create a user pool to manage your app's users. You can then use a Cognito Identity Pool to exchange a token from the user pool for temporary, limited-privilege AWS credentials, allowing the authenticated app user to access resources like an S3 bucket.
---
Question #: 185
What is the effect of attaching the `AWSDenyAll` policy (a custom policy that denies `*:*` on resource `*`) to an IAM user?

A. It has no effect if the user has other `Allow` policies.
B. It prevents the user from performing any action in AWS.
C. It puts the user's account into a suspended state.
D. It only denies actions performed via the AWS CLI, not the console.

Answer: B

Explanation: An explicit deny (`"Effect": "Deny"`) on all actions (`"Action": "*:*"`) for all resources (`"Resource": "*"`) will override any and all `Allow` statements in any other policy attached to the user or their groups. This effectively blocks the user from doing anything.
---
Question #: 186
A junior developer needs access to view CloudWatch metrics and logs for a specific application but should not be able to modify anything. What is the most secure way to grant this access?

A. Add the developer to the administrators' group.
B. Grant the developer the `CloudWatchReadOnlyAccess` AWS managed policy.
C. Give the developer the credentials for a role that has full CloudWatch access.
D. Create a custom policy granting only `cloudwatch:Get*`, `cloudwatch:List*`, `logs:Describe*`, and `logs:GetLogEvents` actions and attach it to the developer's group.

Answer: D

Explanation: While `CloudWatchReadOnlyAccess` (B) is a good start, the principle of least privilege dictates that access should be scoped down to only the required resources if possible. The most secure and precise option is to create a custom policy that not only specifies read-only actions but could also limit them to specific log groups or metric namespaces related to the application. Option D is the best representation of this principle.
---
Question #: 187
You have configured cross-account access using an IAM role. A user in Account A is trying to assume a role in Account B but is getting a "not authorized" error. The role's trust policy in Account B correctly lists Account A as a trusted principal. What is a likely problem in Account A?

A. The user in Account A does not have the `sts:AssumeRole` permission in their IAM policy.
B. The user in Account A needs to have MFA enabled.
C. Account A and Account B are in different AWS regions.
D. The role in Account B needs a permissions policy.

Answer: A

Explanation: To assume a role, even a correctly configured one, the user or role initiating the request must have the `sts:AssumeRole` permission in its own identity-based policy. This permission must specify the ARN of the role they are trying to assume as a resource. Without this permission, the STS service will deny their request to assume the role.
---
Question #: 188
What is the purpose of an IAM group?

A. To apply a set of permissions to multiple resources at once.
B. A collection of IAM users used to simplify permission management.
C. To create a logical separation of AWS accounts.
D. To define a trusted service principal.

Answer: B

Explanation: An IAM group is simply a collection of IAM users. It is not an identity and cannot be used as a principal. Its sole purpose is to make it easier to manage permissions. You attach policies to the group, and all users in the group inherit those permissions.
---
Question #: 189
An S3 bucket contains sensitive data. You need to ensure that data can only be accessed from within your corporate network and from a specific EC2 role. Which type of policy is best suited for this requirement?

A. An identity-based policy attached to every user.
B. A Service Control Policy.
C. A resource-based policy (a bucket policy).
D. An IAM permissions boundary.

Answer: C

Explanation: A resource-based policy (an S3 bucket policy) is the ideal place to define complex access controls for a resource. You can write a single policy that has statements to allow access to your EC2 role's ARN and also allows access based on a condition key for the source IP address (`aws:SourceIp`), all within the single policy attached directly to the bucket.
---
Question #: 190
You see `iam:PassRole` in a CloudTrail log. What does this event signify?

A. A user has successfully assumed a new role.
B. A user has passed an IAM role to an AWS service, such as when launching an EC2 instance.
C. A user has created a new IAM role.
D. A user has modified the permissions of an IAM role.

Answer: B

Explanation: The `PassRole` action is specifically for the act of granting an AWS service permission to use a role. It is a distinct permission to prevent privilege escalation. Seeing this in CloudTrail means a user authorized an AWS service (like EC2 or Lambda) to use a specific role.
---
Question #: 191
What is the key difference between authentication and authorization in the context of IAM?

A. Authentication is verifying who you are; authorization is determining what you're allowed to do.
B. Authentication is done by IAM; authorization is done by Amazon S3.
C. Authentication uses access keys; authorization uses passwords.
D. Authentication applies to users; authorization applies to groups.

Answer: A

Explanation: This is a fundamental concept. Authentication is the process of verifying identity (e.g., checking a password or access key). Authorization is the process of checking the authenticated identity's permissions (evaluating IAM policies) to see if they are allowed to perform the requested action.
---
Question #: 192
Which IAM policy allows a user to perform any action on any resource?

A. The `PowerUserAccess` AWS managed policy.
B. A custom policy with `"Effect": "Allow", "Action": "*", "Resource": "*"`
C. The `ReadOnlyAccess` AWS managed policy.
D. A custom policy with `"Effect": "Allow", "Action": "*:*", "Resource": "*"`

Answer: D

Explanation: `PowerUserAccess` (A) grants almost full access but explicitly denies management of IAM users and groups. To grant true administrative access, the policy must allow all actions on all resources. The correct syntax for all actions is `"*:*"` or simply `"*"`. Option D is the most accurate representation of an administrative policy.
---
Question #: 193
A company wants to allow users to sign in to the AWS Management Console using their existing Google Workspace (G Suite) credentials. What must be configured?

A. An IAM role for each user in Google Workspace.
B. A trust relationship between AWS IAM and Google as a SAML 2.0 Identity Provider.
C. An IAM user for each person with a password matching their Google password.
D. An AWS Directory Service connector for Google Workspace.

Answer: B

Explanation: This is a standard identity federation scenario. You would configure Google Workspace as a SAML 2.0 Identity Provider (IdP) and configure IAM as a Service Provider (SP). This establishes a trust that allows users authenticated by Google to receive temporary credentials to access AWS by assuming a predefined IAM role.
---
Question #: 194
An IAM policy evaluation results in no `Deny` and no `Allow` for a specific action. What is the outcome?

A. The action is allowed.
B. The action is denied.
C. The user is prompted for MFA.
D. An error is returned.

Answer: B

Explanation: The default result of an IAM policy evaluation is a deny. If, after evaluating all applicable policies, there is no explicit `Allow` statement that matches the request, the request is denied. This is known as an implicit deny.
---
Question #: 195
A company wants to provide its data scientists with access to a specific S3 bucket, but only when they are connected to the corporate VPN. The VPN has a static IP address range. How can this be enforced in the S3 bucket policy?

A. Use a statement with `"Effect": "Allow"` and a `Condition` checking the `aws:SourceIp` against the VPN's IP range.
B. Use a statement with `"Effect": "Deny"` and a `Condition` checking the `s3:LocationConstraint` against the VPN's IP range.
C. Use a statement with `"Effect": "DenyAllExcept"` the VPN's IP range.
D. Use a statement with `"Effect": "Allow"` and a `Principal` set to the VPN's IP range.

Answer: A

Explanation: The correct way to enforce access based on IP address is to use a `Condition` element. You would create a statement that allows the desired S3 actions, and add a condition block with the `IpAddress` condition operator and the `aws:SourceIp` key, providing the VPN's CIDR block as the value. IP addresses cannot be principals (D).
---
Question #: 196
What is the easiest way to determine which IAM user made a specific API call that resulted in an EC2 instance being terminated?

A. Check the IAM credential report.
B. Examine the EC2 instance's system logs.
C. Look for the `TerminateInstances` event in AWS CloudTrail logs.
D. Run the IAM Policy Simulator.

Answer: C

Explanation: AWS CloudTrail is the service that records API activity in your account. You can search the CloudTrail event history for the `TerminateInstances` event. The event details will include the user identity (the IAM user or role) that made the call, the source IP address, the time, and the resources affected.
---
Question #: 197
What is a "service-linked role"?

A. A role that links two AWS services together, such as Kinesis and Lambda.
B. A role that a user creates to delegate permissions to an AWS service.
C. A unique type of IAM role that is predefined by an AWS service and is linked to that service.
D. A role that is linked to an on-premises directory service.

Answer: C

Explanation: A service-linked role (SLR) is a role that an AWS service creates in your account on your behalf when you first use a feature that requires it (e.g., AWS Auto Scaling). The role is predefined with all the permissions the service needs to manage other AWS resources for you. You can't modify its permissions, only its deletion.
---
Question #: 198
An IAM user has two policies attached. Policy 1 allows `ec2:StartInstances` on all resources. Policy 2 denies `ec2:StartInstances` on all resources, but has a `Condition` that the instance must have the tag `Stage=Prod`. What can the user do?

A. The user can start any instance EXCEPT those tagged `Stage=Prod`.
B. The user can ONLY start instances tagged `Stage=Prod`.
C. The user cannot start any instances.
D. The user can start any instance, as the Allow overrides the conditional Deny.

Answer: A

Explanation: The evaluation logic will process both policies. The `Allow` statement in Policy 1 permits the action. However, the `Deny` statement in Policy 2 is also checked. If the instance being started has the tag `Stage=Prod`, the condition in the deny policy is met, and the explicit deny takes precedence, blocking the action. For any instance *without* that tag, the deny condition is not met, so the deny is not applied, and the original allow from Policy 1 takes effect.
---
Question #: 199
A company runs a web application with a predictable, steady-state workload that must be available 24/7. The application runs on a specific family of EC2 instances (m5). To achieve the highest possible discount for this workload, which EC2 purchasing option should be chosen?

A. On-Demand Instances
B. Spot Instances
C. Standard Reserved Instances
D. Convertible Reserved Instances

Answer: C

Explanation: Standard Reserved Instances offer the highest discount (up to 72%) in exchange for a commitment to a specific instance family, size, and region for a 1 or 3-year term. Since the workload is predictable and uses a specific instance family, this provides the best cost savings. On-Demand (A) is flexible but most expensive. Spot (B) is for interruptible workloads. Convertible RIs (D) offer a lower discount in exchange for flexibility to change instance families.
---
Question #: 200
A company needs to store customer data for 7 years to meet compliance requirements. The data is rarely, if ever, accessed after the first 90 days, but if access is needed, it must be available within 12 hours. What is the MOST cost-effective S3 storage class for this long-term archival?

A. S3 Standard
B. S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA)
C. S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval
D. S3 Glacier Deep Archive

Answer: C

Explanation: S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval is designed for archival data where retrieval times of a few hours are acceptable. It offers a very low storage cost. S3 Glacier Deep Archive (D) is even cheaper but has a default retrieval time of 12 hours, which meets the requirement, however, Flexible Retrieval also offers expedited retrievals in minutes, making it more flexible. Given the requirement is *within* 12 hours, Flexible Retrieval is a safe and cost-effective choice. S3 Standard (A) and IA (B) are too expensive for 7-year archival.
---
Question #: 201
A data analytics company runs large-scale batch processing jobs every night. These jobs are fault-tolerant and can be stopped and restarted without losing data. The primary goal is to minimize the cost of the EC2 compute for these jobs. Which purchasing option is the most suitable?

A. On-Demand Instances
B. Spot Instances
C. EC2 Instance Savings Plans
D. Dedicated Hosts

Answer: B

Explanation: Spot Instances are the most cost-effective option for workloads that are fault-tolerant and can handle interruptions. Since the batch jobs can be restarted, they are a perfect fit for leveraging AWS's spare compute capacity at discounts of up to 90% off the On-Demand price.
---
Question #: 202
A company stores user-uploaded images in an S3 bucket. They are unsure about the access patterns; some images are very popular for a few weeks and then rarely accessed, while others have unpredictable access patterns. They want to automatically optimize storage costs without affecting performance. Which S3 storage class should they use for these images?

A. S3 Standard
B. S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA)
C. S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval
D. S3 Intelligent-Tiering

Answer: D

Explanation: S3 Intelligent-Tiering is the purpose-built solution for data with unknown, changing, or unpredictable access patterns. It automatically moves objects between a frequent access tier and an infrequent access tier (and optional archive tiers) based on actual access patterns, optimizing costs without any performance impact or operational overhead.
---
Question #: 203
A company has a steady-state workload and commits to a 3-year term for an "EC2 Instance Savings Plan". What is a key benefit of this plan compared to a Standard Reserved Instance?

A. It provides a higher discount than a Standard RI.
B. It provides the flexibility to change the instance family (e.g., from m5 to c5) and region while still receiving a discount.
C. It can be applied to AWS Fargate and Lambda usage.
D. It only applies to a specific Availability Zone.

Answer: B

Explanation: The key benefit of an EC2 Instance Savings Plan over a Standard RI is flexibility. While both offer similar discounts, the Savings Plan commits you to a specific instance family in a specific region (e.g., m5 in us-east-1), but you are free to change the instance size (e.g., from m5.large to m5.xlarge) or even operating system and still receive the discount. A Standard RI locks you into a specific size as well. Note: A *Compute* Savings Plan provides even more flexibility, including changing region and family.
---
Question #: 204
You are configuring an S3 Lifecycle policy for a bucket containing log files. The policy has two rules:
1. Transition objects to S3 Standard-IA after 30 days.
2. Expire (delete) objects after 365 days.
An object is uploaded on January 1st. What is its status on February 15th of the same year?

A. It is still in S3 Standard.
B. It has been transitioned to S3 Standard-IA.
C. It has been deleted.
D. It has been moved to S3 Glacier.

Answer: B

Explanation: On January 1st, the object is uploaded to S3 Standard. The first lifecycle rule is to transition after 30 days. On January 31st (30 days later), the object becomes eligible and is transitioned to S3 Standard-IA. Therefore, on February 15th, the object resides in the S3 Standard-IA storage class.
---
Question #: 205
A company has a baseline compute usage of approximately $10/hour across various instance families and regions. This usage is consistent and will remain for at least one year. They want a purchasing option that provides the most flexibility to adapt to new instance types and regions in the future. Which option is BEST?

A. Standard Reserved Instances
B. Convertible Reserved Instances
C. Compute Savings Plan
D. EC2 Instance Savings Plan

Answer: C

Explanation: A Compute Savings Plan offers the highest degree of flexibility. You commit to a certain amount of spend (e.g., $10/hour) for a term, and in return, you receive a discount. This discount automatically applies to your usage regardless of instance family, size, OS, tenancy, or AWS Region. It also applies to Fargate and Lambda usage. This is more flexible than RIs or an EC2 Instance Savings Plan.
---
Question #: 206
A company stores critical, frequently accessed data in an S3 bucket. They cannot tolerate any data loss, even from the failure of an entire Availability Zone. Which storage class should be used?

A. S3 Standard
B. S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA)
C. S3 Glacier Deep Archive
D. An EBS volume

Answer: A

Explanation: S3 Standard is designed for high durability and availability for frequently accessed data. It achieves this by storing data redundantly across a minimum of three Availability Zones. This design means it can withstand the loss of an entire AZ without any data loss or disruption of availability. S3 One Zone-IA (B) is not resilient to an AZ failure as it stores data in only one AZ.
---
Question #: 207
For which of the following workloads would an On-Demand EC2 instance be the most cost-effective choice?

A. A stateful, 24/7 database server with a predictable load.
B. A short-term, spiky workload for a new application being developed and tested, where the usage pattern is unknown.
C. A fault-tolerant, nightly batch processing job.
D. A web server with a consistent traffic pattern that will run for at least 3 years.

Answer: B

Explanation: On-Demand instances are ideal for workloads where you cannot predict the usage pattern, that are short-term, or that cannot be interrupted. The pay-by-the-second model provides maximum flexibility without any long-term commitment, which is perfect for development and testing environments. The other options are better suited for RIs/Savings Plans (A, D) or Spot Instances (C).
---
Question #: 208
An S3 Lifecycle policy is configured to transition objects to S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval. What is the minimum number of days an object must be stored in its current class before it can be transitioned?

A. 0 days. Objects can be transitioned immediately.
B. 30 days for S3 Standard and S3 Standard-IA.
C. 90 days for S3 Standard and S3 Standard-IA.
D. 180 days for S3 Standard and S3 Standard-IA.

Answer: B

Explanation: S3 has minimum storage duration requirements for certain transitions to prevent misuse of the pricing tiers. For transitions from S3 Standard or S3 Standard-IA to any of the Glacier classes or Intelligent-Tiering's archive tiers, the object must be stored for at least 30 days in its current class.
---
Question #: 209
A company has purchased a 1-year, All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance. What does "All Upfront" mean?

A. They pay for the entire 1-year term in a single payment at the beginning, receiving the highest possible discount for that RI type.
B. They pay nothing upfront but are billed a discounted hourly rate.
C. They pay a portion of the cost upfront and the rest in monthly installments.
D. They are billed based on the number of instances they reserve.

Answer: A

Explanation: Reserved Instances have three payment options. "All Upfront" provides the largest discount because you pay the full cost of the entire reservation term (1 or 3 years) in one payment at the start. "Partial Upfront" involves a smaller upfront payment and then discounted monthly bills. "No Upfront" has the lowest discount and involves only discounted monthly bills.
---
Question #: 210
A company stores medical images that are accessed frequently for the first 30 days by doctors. After 30 days, they are accessed on average once a month for the next year. After one year, they are rarely accessed but must be kept for 7 years. What is the MOST cost-effective lifecycle configuration?

A. S3 Standard for 30 days, then transition to S3 Standard-IA, then expire after 7 years.
B. S3 Standard for 30 days, then transition to S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval, then expire after 7 years.
C. S3 Standard for 30 days, then transition to S3 Standard-IA, then transition to S3 Glacier Deep Archive after 365 days, then expire after 7 years.
D. Use S3 Intelligent-Tiering for the entire 7-year period.

Answer: C

Explanation: This configuration perfectly matches the access patterns. S3 Standard is for the initial 30 days of frequent access. S3 Standard-IA is cost-effective for the next year of infrequent but rapid-access needs. S3 Glacier Deep Archive is the absolute cheapest option for the final 6 years of long-term archival where slow retrieval is acceptable. Expiring the objects after 7 years meets the final requirement.
---
Question #: 211
Which EC2 purchasing option provides a capacity reservation in a specific Availability Zone?

A. On-Demand Instances
B. Spot Instances
C. Zonal Reserved Instances
D. A Compute Savings Plan

Answer: C

Explanation: A key feature of Reserved Instances is that they can provide a capacity reservation. A Zonal RI reserves capacity for a specific instance type in a specific Availability Zone. This guarantees that you will be able to launch an instance with those attributes when you need it. Regional RIs and Savings Plans provide a discount but do not reserve capacity.
---
Question #: 212
An object is stored in the S3 One Zone-IA storage class. What is a key risk associated with this storage class compared to S3 Standard-IA?

A. It has a lower durability guarantee.
B. It has higher latency for data retrieval.
C. The data will be lost if the single Availability Zone where it is stored fails.
D. There is a high cost for retrieving the data.

Answer: C

Explanation: The "One Zone" in the name is the key. Unlike other S3 storage classes that store data across at least three AZs, S3 One Zone-IA stores data in a single Availability Zone. This makes it cheaper, but it also means that if that specific AZ is destroyed or becomes unavailable, the data will be lost. It is only suitable for data that is recreatable.
---
Question #: 213
A company has a workload that runs on a fleet of c5.large instances for a consistent 40 hours per week (e.g., during business hours). Which purchasing option would provide a discount for this specific usage pattern?

A. This is not possible; you must commit to 24/7 usage for a discount.
B. A scheduled Reserved Instance.
C. A Spot Block reservation.
D. A Compute Savings Plan.

Answer: B

Explanation: Scheduled Reserved Instances are a specific purchasing option that allows you to reserve capacity for a recurring, predictable time window (daily, weekly, or monthly). This is a perfect fit for a workload that only runs during specific hours, as you only pay for the time you have reserved.
---
Question #: 214
What is the primary purpose of an S3 Lifecycle policy?

A. To automatically replicate objects to another region.
B. To manage access control for objects in a bucket.
C. To automate the transition of objects to different storage classes or to expire them to manage costs.
D. To track the version history of objects.

Answer: C

Explanation: A lifecycle policy is a cost optimization tool. It allows you to define rules that automatically move your objects through the different S3 storage classes (e.g., from Standard to IA to Glacier) as they age and are accessed less frequently. You can also create rules to permanently delete old objects.
---
Question #: 215
A company has purchased a Compute Savings Plan. They are currently running a mix of m5.large instances in us-east-1 and c5.large instances in eu-west-1. They decide to shut down the c5 instances and launch some AWS Fargate tasks instead. How will the Savings Plan apply?

A. It will no longer apply as the instance family and region have changed.
B. It will continue to apply to the m5.large instances, and the unused portion of the commitment will also automatically apply to the AWS Fargate usage.
C. It will only apply to the m5.large instances; the Fargate usage will be billed at On-Demand rates.
D. The Savings Plan will be automatically cancelled.

Answer: B

Explanation: This demonstrates the flexibility of a Compute Savings Plan. The discount applies automatically to any compute usage across instance families, regions, and compute services like Fargate and Lambda. The system will always apply the discount to the usage in the most optimal way to maximize your savings.
---
Question #: 216
You need to store a 10 TB dataset for a year. The data will be accessed once per quarter for a reporting job that can take up to 8 hours to run. Which storage solution offers the lowest cost for storing this data?

A. An EBS st1 volume
B. S3 Standard-IA
C. S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval
D. S3 Glacier Deep Archive

Answer: D

Explanation: For data that is accessed very rarely (once a quarter) and where a long retrieval time (up to 12 hours for standard retrieval) is acceptable, S3 Glacier Deep Archive provides the lowest possible storage cost on AWS. This makes it ideal for long-term archival where immediate access is not a requirement.
---
Question #: 217
When is it most cost-effective to use an On-Demand EC2 instance?

A. For a predictable, 24/7 workload that will run for 3 years.
B. For a fault-tolerant batch processing job that can be interrupted.
C. For a new application with an unknown, spiky traffic pattern.
D. For a database that requires a capacity reservation.

Answer: C

Explanation: The flexibility of On-Demand pricing (paying by the second with no commitment) is perfect for workloads that are unpredictable, spiky, or short-term. It allows you to handle traffic bursts without being locked into a long-term plan, making it ideal for new applications where the usage pattern has not yet been established.

Question #: 218
A lifecycle rule is configured to expire objects 180 days after creation. The bucket also has versioning enabled. What happens when the rule runs on an object that is 200 days old?

A. The object and all its previous versions are permanently deleted.
B. The current version of the object is permanently deleted.
C. S3 adds a delete marker to the object, but the previous versions are retained.
D. The rule fails because the object has multiple versions.

Answer: C

Explanation: When you set an expiration action on a versioned bucket, it does not permanently delete the current version of the object. Instead, to preserve the object's history, S3 adds a delete marker, which becomes the new "current" version. The previous versions are unaffected. To delete old versions, you must create a separate lifecycle rule specifically for noncurrent versions.

Question #: 219
Which of the following is a key difference between a Standard Reserved Instance and a Convertible Reserved Instance?

A. Standard RIs can be sold on the RI Marketplace, while Convertible RIs cannot.
B. Standard RIs provide a capacity reservation, while Convertible RIs do not.
C. Standard RIs are locked to a specific instance family, while Convertible RIs can be exchanged for another RI of a different family.
D. Standard RIs have a 3-year term, while Convertible RIs have a 1-year term.

Answer: C

Explanation: The key feature of a Convertible RI is its flexibility. During the term, you can exchange your Convertible RI for another one with different attributes, such as a different instance family, size, or operating system, as long as the new RI is of equal or greater value. Standard RIs are locked into their original instance family and size. This flexibility comes with a slightly lower discount compared to Standard RIs.

Question #: 220
Data is stored in S3 Intelligent-Tiering. After 180 days of no access, you want the data to be moved to the cheapest possible archival storage. What must be configured?

A. This happens automatically with Intelligent-Tiering.
B. You must configure a separate S3 Lifecycle policy for this transition.
C. You must opt-in to the deep archive access tier within the S3 Intelligent-Tiering configuration.
D. You must manually move the data using the S3 console.

Answer: C

Explanation: The S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class has optional, opt-in "Archive Access" and "Deep Archive Access" tiers. By default, it only moves data between the Frequent and Infrequent access tiers. To have it automatically move data to an even cheaper archive tier after a longer period (e.g., 90, 180 days), you must explicitly enable and configure these archive tiers in the storage class settings.
---
Question #: 221
A company has a large fleet of EC2 instances running various workloads across multiple regions. The overall usage is very stable. They want to get a discount on their compute spend while maintaining the flexibility to change instance types and regions as their applications evolve. Which is the best purchasing option?

A. Purchase Standard RIs for each specific instance type in each region.
B. Purchase a Compute Savings Plan with a 3-year term.
C. Use Spot Instances for the entire fleet.
D. Use On-Demand instances and rely on Auto Scaling to manage costs.

Answer: B

Explanation: A Compute Savings Plan is the perfect fit for this scenario. It provides a significant discount in exchange for a commitment to a consistent amount of compute usage (in $/hour). The key benefit is its flexibility: the discount automatically applies to any EC2 instance usage, anywhere in the world, regardless of family or region. It also applies to Fargate and Lambda, making it ideal for a diverse and evolving environment.
---
Question #: 222
What happens when you request to retrieve an object that is stored in S3 Glacier Deep Archive?

A. The object is available for download instantly.
B. The retrieval process must be initiated first, and the data is typically available within 12 hours.
C. The object is moved to S3 Standard and can then be downloaded.
D. You must contact AWS Support to retrieve the object.

Answer: B

Explanation: Data in archival storage classes like Glacier Deep Archive is not instantly accessible. You must first initiate a restore request. For S3 Glacier Deep Archive, the standard retrieval time is within 12 hours. Once the restore is complete, a temporary copy of the object is made available in S3 for you to download.
---
Question #: 223
Which two factors are considered when AWS applies a Savings Plan discount to your usage? (Choose TWO)

A. The AWS Region of the resource.
B. The tag applied to the resource.
C. The type of Savings Plan (Compute or EC2 Instance).
D. The committed hourly spend of the plan.
E. The number of security groups attached.

Answer: C, D

Explanation: The Savings Plan calculation is based on your commitment and the plan type. You commit to a certain amount of hourly spend (e.g., $5/hour) (D). The type of plan (C) determines the flexibility. A Compute Savings Plan applies that commitment to almost any compute usage, while an EC2 Instance Savings Plan applies it only to a specific instance family in a specific region. The system then automatically finds the best application of your committed spend to maximize your discount.
---
Question #: 224
A bucket has a lifecycle policy to transition noncurrent object versions to S3 Glacier Deep Archive after 60 days. The bucket has versioning enabled. An object is created, then updated 10 days later, and then updated again 20 days after that. When does the first noncurrent version become eligible for transition?

A. 60 days after the object was first created.
B. 60 days after the second version was created.
C. 70 days after the object was first created.
D. 90 days after the object was first created.

Answer: C

Explanation: The lifecycle policy for noncurrent versions is based on the age of the version itself. The first version becomes noncurrent on day 10 when the second version is uploaded. The 60-day timer for this noncurrent version starts on day 10. Therefore, it becomes eligible for transition 60 days after day 10, which is on day 70.
---
Question #: 225
A company wants to run a critical database on a physical server that is not shared with any other customer. They also need to bring their own per-socket software licenses to AWS. Which EC2 purchasing option meets these requirements?

A. Dedicated Instances
B. Dedicated Hosts
C. Reserved Instances
D. On-Demand Capacity Reservations

Answer: B

Explanation: A Dedicated Host provides a physical server dedicated entirely to your use. This is crucial for "Bring Your Own License" (BYOL) scenarios where software licenses are tied to physical attributes like sockets or cores. It gives you visibility into the physical server and control over instance placement, which is not available with Dedicated Instances.
---
Question #: 226
Which S3 storage class is designed for data that is accessed less than once a month but requires millisecond retrieval times when it is accessed?

A. S3 Standard
B. S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA)
C. S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval
D. S3 Glacier Deep Archive

Answer: B

Explanation: S3 Standard-IA is the perfect fit. It offers a lower storage price than S3 Standard in exchange for a per-GB data retrieval fee. Critically, it provides the same high-throughput, low-latency performance as S3 Standard, so when you do need to access the data, it's available instantly.
---
Question #: 227
A company has a very large, fault-tolerant rendering workload that can be run at any time of day. They want to use Spot Instances. To minimize the chance of their instances being interrupted, what is a good strategy?

A. Use only one specific, popular instance type.
B. Run the workload only during peak business hours.
C. Configure the Spot Fleet or Auto Scaling group to be flexible across multiple instance types and multiple Availability Zones.
D. Set the maximum Spot price to be equal to the On-Demand price.

Answer: C

Explanation: A key strategy for using Spot effectively is flexibility. By configuring your request to be able to use a variety of different instance types (e.g., m5.large, m4.large, c5.large) and to launch in any of the AZs in a region, you are tapping into a much larger pool of spare capacity. This significantly reduces the likelihood that a price spike in one specific Spot pool will cause your instances to be interrupted.
---
Question #: 228
An S3 lifecycle configuration has a rule to expire objects. What is the smallest unit of time you can specify for this rule?

A. 1 hour
B. 12 hours
C. 1 day
D. 30 days

Answer: C

Explanation: S3 lifecycle rules for transitions and expirations operate on a daily basis. The smallest time period you can specify in a rule is one day. The actions are not performed in real-time but are part of an asynchronous daily process.
---
Question #: 229
What is a key difference between a Savings Plan and a Reserved Instance?

A. Savings Plans require a 3-year commitment, while RIs can be 1 year.
B. Savings Plans are applied automatically to usage across instance families and regions (for Compute plans), while RIs are less flexible.
C. RIs offer a higher discount than Savings Plans for the same commitment.
D. Savings Plans provide a capacity reservation, while RIs do not.

Answer: B

Explanation: The primary benefit and difference of Savings Plans is their flexibility. After you make a commitment, the savings are applied automatically to your compute usage without you needing to perform any manual exchanges or modifications. A Compute Savings Plan automatically adapts as you change instance families, sizes, or even regions. RIs, especially Standard RIs, require you to match the usage to the specific reservation to get the benefit.
---
Question #: 230
A medical archive stores X-ray images. The images must be retrievable within 5 minutes for emergency consultations. The images are, on average, accessed only once a year. What is the MOST cost-effective S3 storage class?

A. S3 Standard-IA
B. S3 One Zone-IA
C. S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval
D. S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval

Answer: C

Explanation: S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval is designed for this "long-term storage with instant access" use case. It offers the same millisecond, synchronous retrieval performance as S3 Standard, but with a much lower storage cost. This makes it ideal for archives where you need immediate access when a request comes in. Standard-IA (A) would also work but is slightly more expensive to store. Flexible Retrieval (D) is too slow.
---
Question #: 231
A company wants to reserve compute capacity for a one-time event that will last for 4 hours next Saturday. They need a guarantee that the capacity will be available. Which purchasing option allows for this?

A. Spot Block
B. A short-term Reserved Instance
C. An On-Demand Capacity Reservation
D. A Scheduled Reserved Instance

Answer: C

Explanation: An On-Demand Capacity Reservation allows you to reserve a specific amount of EC2 capacity in a specific AZ for any duration, without a 1-year or 3-year commitment. You pay the equivalent of On-Demand rates for the capacity while it is reserved, but it gives you the peace of mind that the capacity is guaranteed to be there when you need to launch your instances.
---
Question #: 232
An S3 bucket has versioning enabled. A lifecycle policy is configured to "Expire current object versions" after 365 days. What does this action do?

A. It permanently deletes the object and all its versions.
B. It adds a delete marker to the object.
C. It transitions the object to S3 Glacier Deep Archive.
D. It deletes any noncurrent versions of the object.

Answer: B

Explanation: For a versioned object, the "Expire current version" action does not actually delete the data. It adds a delete marker, which becomes the new current version of the object, making it appear as if it was deleted. The previous data versions are preserved as noncurrent versions.
---
Question #: 233
A company has a very stable application running on `m5.xlarge` instances 24/7. They will be using this setup for at least the next 3 years. They want the absolute lowest possible cost. What is their best option?

A. A 3-year, All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance.
B. A 3-year, No Upfront, Compute Savings Plan.
C. A 1-year, Partial Upfront, Convertible Reserved Instance.
D. Spot Instances.

Answer: A

Explanation: To get the maximum possible discount, you need to provide the highest level of commitment. A 3-year term offers a higher discount than a 1-year term. An All Upfront payment offers a higher discount than Partial or No Upfront. A Standard RI offers a higher discount than a Convertible RI or a Savings Plan because it is the least flexible. Combining all of these (3-year, All Upfront, Standard RI) will yield the lowest hourly rate for that specific instance.
---
Question #: 234
Which S3 storage class is physically stored in only one Availability Zone?

A. S3 Standard
B. S3 Standard-IA
C. S3 Intelligent-Tiering
D. S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: D

Explanation: As its name implies, S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access stores data in a single AZ. This lack of multi-AZ resilience is what makes it about 20% cheaper than the architecturally similar S3 Standard-IA class. It's suitable for infrequently accessed data that can be easily recreated if the AZ fails.
---
Question #: 235
You have purchased an EC2 Instance Savings Plan for the `c5` family in the `eu-west-1` region. Which of the following usage will be covered by the plan?

A. A c5.large instance running in us-east-1.
B. A t3.micro instance running in eu-west-1.
C. A c5.2xlarge instance running in eu-west-1.
D. An m5.large instance running in eu-west-1.

Answer: C

Explanation: An EC2 Instance Savings Plan provides a discount for a specific instance family in a specific region. It provides the flexibility to change the instance size (e.g., from `.large` to `.2xlarge`), OS, or tenancy within that family and region. It would not cover a different region (A), a different instance family (B, D).
---
Question #: 236
A company wants to archive 500 TB of data. They estimate they will need to retrieve about 5% of this data per month. Retrieval requests are urgent and must be completed in 1-5 minutes. Which storage class provides this retrieval speed at the lowest storage cost?

A. S3 Standard-IA
B. S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval
C. S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval with Expedited retrieval
D. S3 Glacier Deep Archive with Bulk retrieval

Answer: C

Explanation: S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval offers several retrieval options. Its "Expedited" retrieval option is designed for urgent requests and can typically return data in 1-5 minutes. While Glacier Instant Retrieval (B) is also fast, Glacier Flexible Retrieval has a lower per-GB storage cost, which would be more significant for a 500 TB archive. This makes it the best balance of low storage cost and fast retrieval capability for this use case.
---
Question #: 237
When is it a good idea to use a Convertible Reserved Instance instead of a Standard Reserved Instance?

A. When you need the absolute highest possible discount.
B. When your workload is intermittent and can be interrupted.
C. When you have a steady-state workload but you anticipate that you might need to change to a different instance family in the future.
D. When you need to reserve capacity in a specific Availability Zone.

Answer: C

Explanation: The primary benefit of a Convertible RI is flexibility. If you are not certain that you will stick with the same instance family for the entire 1 or 3-year term, a Convertible RI is a safer choice. It allows you to exchange your reservation for one covering a different instance family, OS, or tenancy, adapting to your changing needs. This flexibility comes at the cost of a slightly lower discount than a Standard RI.
---
Question #: 238
A lifecycle policy is configured on a versioned bucket to transition noncurrent versions to S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval after 30 days and then permanently delete them after 365 days. An object is uploaded on day 1 and then overwritten with a new version on day 10. When is the original version permanently deleted?

A. On day 365
B. On day 375
C. On day 40
D. It is never deleted.

Answer: B

Explanation: The original version becomes noncurrent on day 10. The 365-day expiration timer for this noncurrent version starts on day 10. Therefore, it will be permanently deleted 365 days after day 10, which is day 375 (10 + 365).
---
Question #: 239
Which of the following EC2 instance types can be covered by a Savings Plan?

A. On-Demand
B. Spot Instances
C. Reserved Instances
D. Both A and C

Answer: A

Explanation: Savings Plans are a pricing model that gives you a discount on your On-Demand instance usage. You commit to a certain amount of spend, and any On-Demand usage up to that commitment is charged at the lower Savings Plan rate. They do not apply to Spot or Reserved Instances (which are already discounted).
---
Question #: 240
An object in an S3 bucket is 50 days old. A lifecycle rule is configured to transition objects to S3 Standard-IA after 30 days. There is a separate fee associated with this lifecycle transition. What is this fee for?

A. The S3 API PUT request that performs the transition.
B. The cost of storing the object for the first 30 days.
C. An early deletion fee.
D. A fee for data transfer out of S3.

Answer: A

Explanation: A lifecycle transition is an automated action, but it is still fundamentally a request made on your behalf to move the object. S3 charges a small, per-object fee for the PUT/COPY requests that are used to move objects between storage classes. For a bucket with millions of small objects, these transition costs can be a factor in your overall cost optimization strategy.
---
Question #: 241
Which pricing model requires a 1- or 3-year commitment in exchange for a discount on a specific instance configuration (e.g., m5.large in us-east-1a)?

A. Spot Instances
B. On-Demand
C. Zonal Reserved Instances
D. Compute Savings Plan

Answer: C

Explanation: A Zonal Reserved Instance is the most specific type of commitment. It provides both a discount and a capacity reservation for a particular instance type and size in a specific Availability Zone for a 1 or 3-year term.
---
Question #: 242
A company wants to store data with changing access patterns in the most cost-effective way. They have enabled S3 Intelligent-Tiering and have also enabled the optional Deep Archive Access tier after 180 days. An object is not accessed for 200 days. Where will the object be stored?

A. S3 Standard
B. S3 Infrequent Access tier
C. S3 Archive Access tier
D. S3 Deep Archive Access tier

Answer: D

Explanation: S3 Intelligent-Tiering automatically moves the object from the Frequent Access tier to the Infrequent Access tier after 30 days of no access. Since the optional Deep Archive tier is enabled for after 180 days of no access, the object will be moved there. On day 200, it would reside in the Deep Archive Access tier.
---
Question #: 243
What is the primary benefit of a "No Upfront" Reserved Instance payment option?

A. It provides the highest possible discount.
B. It allows you to get a discounted hourly rate without any initial capital expenditure.
C. It allows you to pay for the entire reservation at the end of the term.
D. It does not require a time commitment.

Answer: B

Explanation: The "No Upfront" option is ideal for companies that want to take advantage of the discounted RI rates but do not want to or cannot make a large upfront payment. You still make a 1 or 3-year commitment, but your entire cost is paid via a discounted hourly bill each month.
---
Question #: 244
A company has a legal requirement to store financial records for 10 years. The data is almost never accessed. If a regulatory body requests a record, the company has up to 48 hours to provide it. What is the most cost-optimized storage solution?

A. An EBS Throughput Optimized HDD (st1) volume.
B. S3 Standard-IA storage.
C. S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval.
D. S3 Glacier Deep Archive.

Answer: D

Explanation: This is a perfect use case for S3 Glacier Deep Archive. It is the lowest-cost storage option in AWS. Its standard retrieval time is 12 hours, and bulk retrieval can take longer, but both are well within the 48-hour requirement. The extremely low storage cost makes it ideal for this kind of long-term, "write-once, read-never" archival.
---
Question #: 245
Which two of the following are characteristics of Spot Instances? (Choose TWO)

A. They offer the largest discounts on EC2 compute capacity.
B. They provide a capacity reservation.
C. They can be interrupted by AWS with a two-minute warning.
D. They are ideal for stateful, critical workloads like databases.
E. They have a fixed hourly price.

Answer: A, C

Explanation: The two defining characteristics of Spot Instances are their potential for huge cost savings (up to 90% off On-Demand) (A) and the fact that they are not guaranteed. AWS can reclaim the capacity at any time, giving your instance a two-minute notification before it is terminated (C). This makes them suitable only for fault-tolerant workloads.
---
Question #: 246
An S3 lifecycle policy is configured to transition objects to S3 One Zone-IA. What is a key consideration for this policy?

A. The objects will be replicated to a second region for durability.
B. The objects will have a lower level of durability and availability than if they were transitioned to S3 Standard-IA.
C. The objects will no longer be instantly accessible.
D. The storage cost will be higher than S3 Standard-IA.

Answer: B

Explanation: By transitioning data to S3 One Zone-IA, you are accepting a lower level of resilience in exchange for a lower storage cost. Because the data is only stored in a single Availability Zone, it is vulnerable to loss in the event of a disaster that affects that entire AZ.
---
Question #: 247
A company wants to commit to a certain level of EC2 usage for one year to get a discount, but they are not sure which instance family they will use. Which purchasing option offers a discount while allowing the flexibility to change instance families?

A. Standard Reserved Instances
B. Convertible Reserved Instances
C. Spot Fleet
D. Dedicated Instances

Answer: B

Explanation: This is the exact use case for Convertible Reserved Instances. They allow you to exchange your reservation for another one of a different instance family, size, or OS during the term. This provides a way to get a good discount while still being able to adapt your infrastructure as your needs change.
---
Question #: 248
What is the primary purpose of setting an expiration (deletion) rule in an S3 lifecycle policy?

A. To improve the performance of S3 GET requests.
B. To automatically delete old, unneeded objects to reduce storage costs.
C. To version objects in the bucket.
D. To encrypt objects after a certain period.

Answer: B

Explanation: An expiration action is a cost and data management tool. It allows you to define a rule that will automatically and permanently delete objects after they reach a certain age. This is crucial for managing data like logs or temporary files that have a finite useful lifespan, as it prevents you from paying for storage indefinitely.
---
Question #: 249
You have purchased a regional Reserved Instance for an m5.large instance in us-east-1. The RI has a size flexibility benefit. Currently, you are not running any m5.large instances, but you are running two m5.large instances. How will the RI discount be applied?
*Correction*: Let's assume the question meant "you are running two m5.xlarge instances" or something different. Let's assume it meant "you are running two m5.large instances". The question is then a bit odd. Let's assume it's a typo and the user meant "you are running two m5.2xlarge instances". Let's rephrase. "you are not running any m5.large instances, but you are running one m5.2xlarge instance".

A. The discount will not be applied as you are not running the exact instance size.
B. The discount for one m5.large will be applied to a portion of the cost of the m5.2xlarge instance.
C. The RI will be automatically converted to cover the m5.2xlarge instance.
D. The discount will be applied to a random instance in your account.

Answer: B

Explanation: Regional RIs with size flexibility are applied based on a normalization factor. An m5.2xlarge is considered 4 "units" while an m5.large is 2 "units". If you have a reservation for an m5.large, the discount for those 2 units of capacity will be applied to a portion of the cost of the larger instance. The remaining portion of the m5.2xlarge's cost will be billed at the On-Demand rate.
---
Question #: 250
Which S3 storage class incurs a per-GB retrieval fee in addition to the monthly storage cost? (Choose TWO)

A. S3 Standard
B. S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA)
C. S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA)
D. S3 Intelligent-Tiering
E. All S3 Glacier storage classes

Answer: B, C, E

Explanation: The trade-off for lower storage costs in the infrequent access and archival tiers is a data retrieval fee. S3 Standard-IA (B), S3 One Zone-IA (C), and all the S3 Glacier classes (E) charge a fee for every gigabyte of data you retrieve from them. S3 Standard (A) has no retrieval fees. S3 Intelligent-Tiering (D) has no retrieval fees for moving data between tiers, only for accessing data that is in an infrequent or archive tier.
---
Question #: 251
A company has a fleet of servers with a very consistent and predictable usage pattern. They want to maximize their savings and are confident in their 3-year forecast. What is the most financially optimal purchasing strategy?

A. Use On-Demand instances and scale down during off-hours.
B. Purchase a 1-year, No Upfront Compute Savings Plan.
C. Purchase 3-year, All Upfront Standard Reserved Instances for their baseline capacity.
D. Use a fleet of Spot Instances.

Answer: C

Explanation: To achieve the maximum possible discount, you should choose the options with the highest commitment. A 3-year term provides a much higher discount than a 1-year term. An All Upfront payment provides a higher discount than Partial or No Upfront. A Standard RI provides a higher discount than a more flexible option like a Savings Plan. Combining these provides the absolute lowest hourly rate.
---
Question #: 252
A lifecycle policy is configured to transition objects to S3 Glacier Deep Archive after 90 days. What is the typical retrieval time for an object from this storage class?

A. Milliseconds
B. 1-5 minutes
C. 3-5 hours
D. 12-48 hours

Answer: D

Explanation: S3 Glacier Deep Archive is designed for long-term archival at the lowest cost, and the trade-off is retrieval time. The "Standard" retrieval tier for Deep Archive is within 12 hours. A "Bulk" retrieval option is also available, which is cheaper per GB but can take up to 48 hours.
---
Question #: 253
What is an EC2 Savings Plan?

A. A plan that provides a discount on all AWS services.
B. A flexible pricing model that offers lower prices than On-Demand, in exchange for a commitment to a consistent amount of compute usage (measured in $/hour) for a 1 or 3-year term.
C. A plan that automatically selects the cheapest EC2 instance for your workload.
D. A way to get a discount on Spot Instances.

Answer: B

Explanation: A Savings Plan is a commitment-based discount model. You agree to pay for a certain amount of compute usage per hour for a term. Any usage up to that commitment is charged at the discounted Savings Plan rate. This is simpler and more flexible than Reserved Instances, as it automatically applies to your usage without you needing to manage the reservations.
---
Question #: 254
For an S3 bucket with versioning enabled, how can you use a lifecycle policy to save costs on storage for old, noncurrent versions?

A. Create a rule to expire noncurrent versions after 0 days.
B. Create a rule to transition noncurrent versions to a lower-cost storage class like S3 Standard-IA or S3 Glacier.
C. This is not possible; all versions are stored in S3 Standard.
D. Create a rule to delete the bucket.

Answer: B

Explanation: A common cost optimization strategy for versioned buckets is to manage the noncurrent versions. You can create a specific lifecycle rule that applies only to noncurrent versions, transitioning them to a cheaper storage class after they have been superseded for a certain number of days (e.g., 30 days). You can also have another rule to permanently delete these noncurrent versions after a longer period.
---
Question #: 255
Which of the following purchasing options offers a discount but does NOT provide a capacity reservation?

A. Zonal Standard Reserved Instance
B. Regional Standard Reserved Instance
C. On-Demand Capacity Reservation
D. Compute Savings Plan

Answer: D

Explanation: Savings Plans provide a financial discount but do not reserve capacity. If you need a guarantee that you can launch a specific instance type in a specific AZ, you must either use a Zonal Reserved Instance or an On-Demand Capacity Reservation. Regional RIs also offer a discount and some size flexibility but do not provide a capacity reservation.
---
Question #: 256
You are storing data that must be immediately accessible but is accessed very infrequently (e.g., once or twice a year). The data must be resilient to the loss of an Availability Zone. Which is the MOST cost-effective storage class?

A. S3 Standard
B. S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA)
C. S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA)
D. S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval

Answer: B

Explanation: S3 Standard-IA is designed for this use case. It stores data across multiple AZs, providing high durability. It offers a lower storage price than S3 Standard, and while it has a retrieval fee, this is cost-effective for data that is truly accessed infrequently. Glacier Instant Retrieval (D) is also an option, but Standard-IA is typically the primary choice for this general "infrequent access" pattern.
---
Question #: 257
A company is running a stateful workload on a single `r5.2xlarge` instance. They anticipate needing to upgrade to an `r5.4xlarge` in about 18 months. They want to get a discount on their compute for a 3-year term. Which RI type should they purchase?

A. A Standard RI for an `r5.2xlarge`.
B. A Convertible RI for an `r5.2xlarge`.
C. A Standard RI for an `r5.4xlarge`.
D. They should use a Savings Plan instead.

Answer: B

Explanation: Since they know they will need to change the instance size during the 3-year term, a Standard RI is not a good choice as it is not flexible. A Convertible RI is the perfect solution. They can purchase one for the `r5.2xlarge` now, and then in 18 months, they can exchange it for a new Convertible RI that covers the `r5.4xlarge` instance.
---
Question #: 258
A bucket has versioning and a lifecycle rule to permanently delete noncurrent versions after 90 days. An object is uploaded on day 1. It is overwritten on day 30. It is deleted on day 50. When is the original version (from day 1) permanently deleted?

A. On day 90
B. On day 120
C. On day 140
D. On day 50

Answer: B

Explanation: The original version (from day 1) becomes a noncurrent version on day 30 when it is overwritten. The 90-day expiration timer for this noncurrent version starts on day 30. Therefore, it will be permanently deleted 90 days after day 30, which is on day 120 (30 + 90). The deletion on day 50 only adds a delete marker and makes the version from day 30 noncurrent.
---
Question #: 259
Which EC2 pricing model allows you to get significant discounts by bidding on unused compute capacity?

A. On-Demand
B. Reserved
C. Spot
D. Dedicated

Answer: C

Explanation: Spot Instances operate on a supply-and-demand market model. You specify the maximum price you are willing to pay for an instance, and as long as the market "Spot price" is below your maximum price, your instance will run. This allows you to access spare EC2 capacity at very large discounts compared to On-Demand prices.

Question #: 260
To use S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval or S3 Glacier Deep Archive, how do you place objects into these storage classes?

A. You must upload them directly to the Glacier service via its own API.
B. You can upload them directly to these classes using the S3 API, or transition them from other S3 classes using a lifecycle policy.
C. You must use the AWS Snowball service.
D. You must encrypt the objects first.

Answer: B

Explanation: Objects can be placed into the Glacier storage classes in two ways. You can directly PUT an object into the `GLACIER` or `DEEP_ARCHIVE` storage class via the S3 API. Alternatively, and more commonly for cost optimization, you can use an S3 Lifecycle policy to automatically transition objects from classes like S3 Standard into the Glacier classes after a certain period of time.

Question #: 261
A company has a very steady workload and buys a 3-year, All Upfront Standard RI for an m5.large instance. Halfway through the term, they no longer need the instance. What can they do to recoup some of their investment?

A. Cancel the Reserved Instance and get a pro-rated refund.
B. Exchange the RI for a smaller instance type.
C. Attempt to sell the remaining term of their Reserved Instance on the EC2 Reserved Instance Marketplace.
D. Nothing, the investment is lost.

Answer: C

Explanation: The RI Marketplace is a platform that allows customers with Standard RIs to sell their unused reservations to other AWS customers. This provides a way to recover some of the cost if your needs change and you no longer require the specific instance you reserved. Convertible RIs cannot be sold on the marketplace.

Question #: 262
Which S3 storage class is MOST appropriate for storing backups of data that can be easily recreated, where low cost is the primary driver and resilience to a single data center failure is not required?

A. S3 Standard
B. S3 Standard-IA
C. S3 One Zone-IA
D. S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval

Answer: C

Explanation: S3 One Zone-IA is specifically designed for this type of use case. It provides a lower storage cost than S3 Standard-IA by storing the data in only a single Availability Zone. This makes it ideal for storing secondary backup copies or other data that can be easily regenerated if the AZ were to fail.
---
Question #: 263
How does an EC2 Instance Savings Plan work?

A. It gives you a discount on any EC2 instance usage, regardless of family or region.
B. It gives you a discount in exchange for a commitment to use a specific instance family in a specific region (e.g., m5 in us-east-1).
C. It gives you a discount on a specific instance type in a specific AZ.
D. It automatically moves your instances to the cheapest available instance type.

Answer: B

Explanation: An EC2 Instance Savings Plan is more specific than a Compute Savings Plan but more flexible than a Standard RI. You commit to a certain spend for a specific instance family in a specific region. In return, you get a discount that applies to any size, OS, or tenancy within that family/region combination.
---
Question #: 264
A company uses a third-party application that is licensed per physical CPU core. To run this application in a cost-effective way and comply with the license, which EC2 option should be used?

A. A Spot Fleet with a diverse set of instance types.
B. On-Demand instances in an Auto Scaling group.
C. A Dedicated Host.
D. A Convertible Reserved Instance.

Answer: C

Explanation: A Dedicated Host provides you with an entire physical server. This is essential for BYOL (Bring Your Own License) scenarios where the license terms are tied to physical hardware attributes like cores or sockets. It gives you the visibility and control needed to prove license compliance.
---
Question #: 265
What is the minimum object size for an object to be eligible for the S3 Standard-IA or S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage classes?

A. There is no minimum size.
B. 1 KB
C. 128 KB
D. 1 MB

Answer: C

Explanation: To be cost-effective, the infrequent access tiers are designed for larger objects. Objects smaller than 128 KB can be stored in S3 Standard-IA or moved into the IA tier of Intelligent-Tiering, but they will be billed for storage as if they were 128 KB in size. Therefore, it is not cost-optimal for very small objects.
---
Question #: 266
A startup is launching a new application and expects its usage to be low at first but to grow rapidly. They want to minimize their initial financial commitment but still get a discount on their compute costs. What is a good strategy?

A. Purchase a 3-year, All Upfront Standard RI.
B. Use On-Demand instances exclusively.
C. Purchase a 1-year, No Upfront Savings Plan with a small initial hourly commitment, and plan to purchase additional plans as usage grows.
D. Use only Spot Instances.

Answer: C

Explanation: A 1-year, No Upfront Savings Plan provides a good balance. The 1-year term is a lower commitment than 3 years. The No Upfront option means no initial cash outlay. By starting with a small hourly commitment that covers their initial baseline, they can get a discount immediately. As their usage grows and becomes more predictable, they can purchase additional Savings Plans to cover the new baseline.
---
Question #: 267
An object is stored in S3 Intelligent-Tiering. It is accessed every day for 45 days, and then not accessed again. What will be the sequence of its storage tiers?

A. It will remain in the Frequent Access tier for the entire duration.
B. Frequent Access for 30 days, then Infrequent Access.
C. Frequent Access for 45 days, then Infrequent Access after another 30 days of no access.
D. Frequent Access for 45 days, then it will be moved to the Infrequent Access tier on day 75.

Answer: D

Explanation: S3 Intelligent-Tiering moves an object to the Infrequent Access tier if it has not been accessed for 30 consecutive days. In this scenario, the object is accessed daily for 45 days, so the 30-day "no access" timer keeps resetting. The timer starts on day 46. After 30 days of no access (on day 75), the object will be moved to the Infrequent Access tier.
---
Question #: 268
Which purchasing option can provide a discount on AWS Fargate usage?

A. Reserved Instances
B. Spot Instances for Fargate
C. Compute Savings Plans
D. Both B and C

Answer: D

Explanation: AWS Fargate, the serverless compute engine for containers, has two discounted pricing models. You can use Compute Savings Plans, which will automatically apply their discount to your Fargate usage. Additionally, AWS offers Fargate Spot, which allows you to run fault-tolerant container tasks on spare capacity at a steep discount, similar to EC2 Spot Instances.
---
Question #: 269
A company has a 3-year Convertible Reserved Instance. What is one of the key benefits they have?

A. They can sell the RI on the marketplace if it's no longer needed.
B. The RI provides the highest possible discount offered by AWS.
C. They can exchange the RI for another of a different instance family, OS, or tenancy.
D. The RI is not billed monthly, only upfront.

Answer: C

Explanation: The defining characteristic of a Convertible RI is the ability to "convert" or exchange it. This allows a company to adapt to new technologies or changing application requirements (e.g., moving from a general-purpose to a compute-optimized instance family) without losing their long-term discounted pricing.
---
Question #: 270
An S3 lifecycle policy is set to delete objects after 1 year. An object is uploaded and then a legal hold is placed on it using S3 Object Lock. What happens after 1 year?

A. The object is deleted by the lifecycle policy.
B. The lifecycle policy fails to delete the object because of the Object Lock.
C. The object is transitioned to Glacier instead of being deleted.
D. The object's version ID is changed.

Answer: B

Explanation: S3 Object Lock is a compliance feature that enforces write-once-read-many (WORM) policies. An object under a legal hold or a retention period cannot be overwritten or deleted by any user or any process, including S3 Lifecycle policies. The expiration action will be ignored for that object until the lock is removed.
---
Question #: 271
For a workload that has a completely predictable, fixed capacity and will run for the next 12 months on `c5.xlarge` instances, which purchasing option will be the most cost-effective?

A. A 1-year Compute Savings Plan
B. A 1-year EC2 Instance Savings Plan for the c5 family.
C. A 1-year Standard Reserved Instance for `c5.xlarge`.
D. On-Demand instances.

Answer: C

Explanation: When the workload is extremely specific and predictable (fixed instance type, size, region, and term), a Standard Reserved Instance will typically offer a slightly higher discount than a more flexible option like a Savings Plan. Because there is no need for flexibility in this scenario, the Standard RI provides the maximum cost savings.
---
Question #: 272
What is the primary cost component of the S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval storage class?

A. A high monthly per-GB storage cost and low retrieval cost.
B. A low monthly per-GB storage cost and a higher per-GB data retrieval fee compared to S3 Standard.
C. A cost per snapshot.
D. A cost per API call, with no storage cost.

Answer: B

Explanation: The pricing model for infrequent access and archival tiers involves a trade-off. You pay a much lower price to store the data per month. However, when you need to access (retrieve) that data, you are charged a per-gigabyte retrieval fee, which is higher than the retrieval cost (which is free) for S3 Standard.
---
Question #: 273
Which statement accurately describes the flexibility of a Compute Savings Plan?

A. It applies only to EC2 instances in a single instance family.
B. It applies only to EC2 instances in a single AWS Region.
C. It applies to EC2, Fargate, and Lambda usage across all instance families, sizes, and regions.
D. It can be sold on the Reserved Instance Marketplace.

Answer: C

Explanation: The Compute Savings Plan is the most flexible discount option. It automatically applies to usage across different compute services (EC2, Fargate, Lambda), instance families, instance sizes, operating systems, tenancies, and AWS Regions, making it ideal for customers with dynamic compute needs.
---
Question #: 274
You have a 50 TB video archive that you need to store at the lowest possible cost. You will almost never need to access it. If you do, a 24-hour retrieval window is perfectly acceptable. Which storage class is the best choice?

A. S3 Standard-IA
B. S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval
C. S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval
D. S3 Glacier Deep Archive

Answer: D

Explanation: This is the exact use case for S3 Glacier Deep Archive. It offers the absolute lowest storage cost in the cloud. The trade-off is a longer retrieval time (12-48 hours), but since this is acceptable for the workload, it is by far the most cost-effective choice for this long-term, cold-storage archive.
---
Question #: 275
A company wants to ensure they always have capacity for 10 `m5.large` instances for a critical application in the `us-east-1a` Availability Zone. What should they purchase?

A. A Regional Reserved Instance for 10 `m5.large` instances.
B. A Zonal Reserved Instance for 10 `m5.large` instances in `us-east-1a`.
C. A Compute Savings Plan for the equivalent cost of 10 `m5.large` instances.
D. A Spot Fleet request for 10 instances.

Answer: B

Explanation: A key benefit of a Zonal Reserved Instance is the capacity reservation. By purchasing a Zonal RI, you are telling AWS that you want a guaranteed slot for that specific instance type in that specific AZ. This ensures that you will always be able to launch those instances, even during periods of high demand in the region. Regional RIs and Savings Plans do not provide this guarantee.
---
Question #: 276
What is the minimum billable object size and storage duration for S3 Standard-IA?

A. 64 KB and 15 days
B. 128 KB and 30 days
C. 256 KB and 60 days
D. There are no minimums.

Answer: B

Explanation: The S3 Standard-IA (and One Zone-IA) storage classes have a minimum billable object size of 128 KB and a minimum storage duration of 30 days. This means that if you store a 10 KB object, you will be billed for 128 KB. If you delete an object after only 10 days, you will be billed for the full 30 days of storage.
---
Question #: 277
A company uses a mix of EC2 and AWS Fargate. Their total compute usage is stable at around $50/hour. They want to get a discount on this usage. Which purchasing option should they choose?

A. A mix of EC2 Reserved Instances and Fargate Reserved Instances.
B. A Compute Savings Plan for $50/hour.
C. An EC2 Instance Savings Plan for $50/hour.
D. Spot Instances for all workloads.

Answer: B

Explanation: A Compute Savings Plan is the ideal choice here because it provides discounts across both EC2 and Fargate usage. By purchasing a single plan, the company can get a discount on their entire compute portfolio without needing to manage separate reservations for each service.
---
Question #: 278
A company has a bucket with versioning enabled. They want to save money by deleting versions of objects that were replaced more than 2 years ago. How can they automate this?

A. This must be done manually with a script.
B. Create an S3 Lifecycle rule to expire noncurrent versions after 730 days.
C. Create an S3 Lifecycle rule to expire current versions after 730 days.
D. Use S3 Intelligent-Tiering to automatically delete old versions.

Answer: B

Explanation: S3 Lifecycle policies can operate on either the current version or the noncurrent (previous) versions of an object. To clean up old versions, you would create a rule that specifically targets noncurrent versions and sets an expiration action to permanently delete them after they have been noncurrent for a specified number of days.
---
Question #: 279
Which EC2 purchasing option provides the most significant discount but carries the risk of the instance being terminated by AWS?

A. On-Demand
B. Reserved Instance
C. Savings Plan
D. Spot Instance

Answer: D

Explanation: Spot Instances offer the largest potential discounts (up to 90%) because you are bidding on AWS's spare, unused compute capacity. The trade-off for this low price is that if AWS needs the capacity back, your instance can be interrupted with a two-minute warning.
---
Question #: 280
A company needs to archive data for 5 years. They need to be able to retrieve specific files within 3-5 hours if required by an auditor. Which storage class offers the best balance of low storage cost and the required retrieval speed?

A. S3 Standard-IA
B. S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval
C. S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval
D. S3 Glacier Deep Archive

Answer: C

Explanation: S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval is designed for archival use cases where occasional, faster retrieval is needed. Its standard retrieval option takes 3-5 hours, which perfectly matches the requirement. This provides a much lower storage cost than the infrequent access tiers while still meeting the auditor's SLA.
---
Question #: 281
What is a key financial benefit of using a Savings Plan over On-Demand pricing?

A. It provides a capacity reservation.
B. It offers a significant discount (up to 72%) in exchange for a 1- or 3-year commitment to a certain amount of usage.
C. It has no time commitment.
D. It eliminates all data transfer costs.

Answer: B

Explanation: The fundamental value proposition of both Savings Plans and Reserved Instances is a financial discount. By committing to use a certain amount of compute over a long term, you help AWS with their capacity planning, and in return, they give you a much lower hourly rate compared to the flexible but more expensive On-Demand model.
---
Question #: 282
A lifecycle policy is configured on a non-versioned bucket to transition objects to S3 Glacier Deep Archive after 90 days and expire them after 10 years. An object is uploaded. After 5 years, it is retrieved. What happens to the object after the retrieval is complete?

A. It remains in S3 Glacier Deep Archive.
B. It is moved back to S3 Standard.
C. It is deleted.
D. A temporary copy is restored, and the original remains in Glacier Deep Archive.

Answer: D

Explanation: Retrieving an object from any of the Glacier tiers is a two-step process. First, you initiate a restore job. When the job is complete, S3 creates a temporary copy of the object in the S3 Standard storage class, which you can then access. The original, archived copy of the object remains unmodified in the Glacier Deep Archive tier.
---
Question #: 283
Which of the following is true for Convertible Reserved Instances?

A. They can be sold on the RI Marketplace.
B. They provide a higher discount than Standard RIs.
C. They can be exchanged for other Convertible RIs with different instance attributes.
D. They do not require a 1- or 3-year term commitment.

Answer: C

Explanation: The defining feature of Convertible RIs is their flexibility. You can exchange them during their term to change attributes like instance family, OS, or tenancy. This allows you to adapt to changing needs while still maintaining a long-term discount.
---
Question #: 284
For which use case is the S3 Standard storage class the most appropriate and cost-effective choice?

A. Long-term archival of compliance data.
B. Storing a secondary copy of a backup that can be recreated.
C. Storing frequently accessed, performance-sensitive data for a dynamic website.
D. Data with completely unknown and unpredictable access patterns.

Answer: C

Explanation: S3 Standard is optimized for low-latency, high-throughput access. It is the best choice for "hot" data that is frequently accessed and requires instant retrieval, such as images for a popular website, application assets, or data for active analytics. For the other use cases, lower-cost tiers would be more appropriate.
---
Question #: 285
A company has a Spot Fleet request. What is a key benefit of using a Spot Fleet over a single Spot request?

A. It guarantees that the instances will never be interrupted.
B. It allows you to request capacity across multiple instance types, sizes, and Availability Zones, which increases the likelihood of fulfilling and maintaining your target capacity.
C. It provides a discount on On-Demand instances.
D. It reserves capacity for a specific duration.

Answer: B

Explanation: A Spot Fleet (or an Auto Scaling group configured to use Spot) allows you to define a target capacity and specify a variety of different instance types and AZs that are acceptable for your workload. The Spot service will then attempt to fulfill your capacity request by launching the lowest-priced instances from across all those different Spot pools. This diversification significantly improves the availability and resilience of your workload on Spot.
---
Question #: 286
A lifecycle policy is set to transition objects to S3 Standard-IA after 30 days. An object is 10 KB in size. After 30 days, it is transitioned. How much storage will this object be billed for in S3 Standard-IA?

A. 10 KB
B. 30 KB
C. 64 KB
D. 128 KB

Answer: D

Explanation: The S3 Standard-IA and One Zone-IA storage classes have a minimum billable object size of 128 KB. Even though the object itself is only 10 KB, it will consume and be billed for 128 KB of storage while it is in that tier.
---
Question #: 287
A company wants the flexibility of a Savings Plan but needs to ensure it gets the highest possible discount for its `m5` instances in `us-east-1`. They have no other compute usage. Which plan should they choose?

A. A Compute Savings Plan
B. An EC2 Instance Savings Plan
C. A combination of both
D. They should use Reserved Instances instead.

Answer: B

Explanation: An EC2 Instance Savings Plan offers a higher discount than a Compute Savings Plan. The trade-off is less flexibility; it only applies to a specific instance family in a specific region. Since the company's usage is confined to exactly that (m5 in us-east-1), the EC2 Instance Savings Plan will give them the best possible discount for a savings plan model.
---
Question #: 288
What is the primary cost-saving mechanism of the S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class?

A. It compresses all objects to reduce their size.
B. It automatically moves objects between frequent and infrequent access tiers based on monitoring access patterns.
C. It stores objects in a single Availability Zone.
D. It has no data retrieval fees.

Answer: B

Explanation: S3 Intelligent-Tiering saves you money by automating the tiering process. Instead of you having to guess which objects are infrequently accessed and creating a lifecycle policy, the storage class itself monitors the objects. If an object is not accessed for 30 consecutive days, it is moved to a lower-cost tier automatically, saving you money without any manual effort or performance impact on access.
---
Question #: 289
You have purchased several Reserved Instances. Where can you go to get a detailed view of how your RIs are being utilized and which of your running instances are receiving the discount?

A. The AWS IAM Console
B. The AWS Cost Explorer and the Reserved Instance utilization reports.
C. The Amazon EC2 Console's instance details page.
D. AWS CloudTrail.

Answer: B

Explanation: AWS Cost Management tools, particularly AWS Cost Explorer, provide detailed reports and visualizations for your RI and Savings Plan utilization. The RI utilization report shows you what percentage of your purchased RI hours were used, helping you identify any waste. The RI coverage report shows what percentage of your total instance usage was covered by reservations.
---
Question #: 290
Which of the following is a direct cost associated with retrieving a large amount of data from S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval?

A. A per-request fee and a per-GB retrieval fee.
B. Only a fee for the amount of time the data is being restored.
C. Only a data transfer out fee.
D. There are no retrieval costs.

Answer: A

Explanation: Retrieving data from the Glacier tiers involves multiple cost components. There is a small fee for each restore request you make. The main cost is the per-gigabyte fee for the amount of data you are restoring. Finally, if you are transferring the data out to the internet, standard S3 data transfer out fees would also apply.
---
Question #: 291
For a workload with a consistent, predictable compute requirement, which option generally provides a better discount: a 1-year RI or a 3-year RI?

A. A 1-year RI
B. A 3-year RI
C. They provide the same discount.
D. It depends on the instance type.

Answer: B

Explanation: The longer the commitment term, the greater the discount AWS provides. A 3-year Reserved Instance or Savings Plan will always offer a significantly higher discount (e.g., up to 60-72%) compared to a 1-year commitment for the same instance.
---
Question #: 292
An S3 lifecycle policy can be based on which of the following criteria?

A. The tags on an object.
B. The size of an object.
C. The age of an object (number of days since creation).
D. All of the above.

Answer: D

Explanation: S3 Lifecycle rules can be quite specific. You can create a rule that applies to all objects in a bucket, or you can filter the scope of the rule based on object prefixes, object tags, or even object size (for multipart uploads). The primary trigger for the action is then the age of the object.
---
Question #: 293
A company is using Spot Instances for a critical part of their data processing pipeline. They are concerned about interruptions. What feature can help them manage this?

A. Spot Blocks, which reserve Spot instances for a defined duration.
B. On-Demand Capacity Reservations.
C. Rebalance Recommendations and Interruption Notices.
D. A Convertible Reserved Instance.

Answer: C

Explanation: The Spot service provides signals to help you manage interruptions gracefully. A "Rebalance Recommendation" is an early signal that an instance is at an elevated risk of being interrupted. An "Interruption Notice" is the final, two-minute warning that the instance will be reclaimed. Your application can be designed to listen for these signals and proactively start moving work off the instance before it is terminated.
---
Question #: 294
Which S3 storage class is designed to have the same low latency and high throughput performance as S3 Standard?

A. S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval
B. S3 Glacier Deep Archive
C. S3 Standard-Infrequent Access
D. All of the above.

Answer: C

Explanation: Both S3 Standard-IA and S3 One Zone-IA are designed for rapid access. They provide the same millisecond first-byte latency and high throughput as the S3 Standard class. The only difference in their model is the pricing: they have a lower storage cost but charge a fee for data retrieval.
---
Question #: 295
You have a 1-year, All Upfront Compute Savings Plan. Three months into the term, you decide you no longer need it. What can you do?

A. Sell the remaining term on a marketplace.
B. Cancel the plan and receive a pro-rated refund.
C. Exchange the plan for a different type.
D. Nothing. A Savings Plan commitment cannot be changed or cancelled once purchased.

Answer: D

Explanation: Unlike Standard RIs, Savings Plans cannot be sold on a marketplace. Once you purchase a Savings Plan for a 1- or 3-year term, you are committed to that hourly spend for the entire duration. The plan cannot be modified or cancelled.
---
Question #: 296
A company has an archive of old project files. The files are almost never needed, but when they are, the company wants the lowest possible retrieval cost, and they are not concerned about how long the retrieval takes. Which retrieval option for S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval should they choose?

A. Expedited
B. Standard
C. Bulk
D. Instant

Answer: C

Explanation: S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval offers three retrieval speeds. "Bulk" retrieval is the slowest option (typically taking 5-12 hours), but it also has the lowest per-GB retrieval cost. This makes it the most cost-effective choice when retrieval time is not a concern.
---
Question #: 297
Which of the following describes a scenario where an EC2 Instance Savings Plan would be MORE cost-effective than a Compute Savings Plan?

A. A company runs a diverse and constantly changing mix of EC2, Fargate, and Lambda workloads across many regions.
B. A company runs a very stable workload using only the `m5` instance family in the `us-west-2` region.
C. A company has a short-term project that will only last 3 months.
D. A company needs to be able to sell their commitment if their needs change.

Answer: B

Explanation: An EC2 Instance Savings Plan offers a higher discount than a Compute Savings Plan. The trade-off is that it is less flexible. If your workload is very stable and you are certain you will continue using a specific instance family in a specific region, the EC2 Instance Savings Plan will provide greater savings because you are making a more specific commitment.
---
Question #: 298
An S3 Lifecycle policy is based on a filter using an object tag ("status": "archive"). What happens to an object that does not have this tag?

A. The lifecycle rule is applied to it by default.
B. The lifecycle rule is not applied to it.
C. The object is deleted immediately.
D. The object is moved to S3 Standard.

Answer: B

Explanation: When you use a filter in a lifecycle rule (based on a prefix, tag, or size), the rule will only evaluate and apply to objects that match that filter. Any object that does not have the "status: archive" tag will be completely ignored by this specific lifecycle rule.
---
Question #: 299
A company wants to receive an email alert when their total monthly AWS bill is forecasted to exceed $1,000. Which AWS service should they use to configure this alert?

A. Amazon CloudWatch
B. AWS Cost Explorer
C. AWS Budgets
D. AWS Trusted Advisor

Answer: C

Explanation: AWS Budgets is the service specifically designed for this purpose. You can create a cost budget, set a monthly amount, and configure it to send an alert based on either actual or forecasted costs, notifying you via email or SNS when a threshold is breached. CloudWatch (A) is for resource metrics, not billing forecasts. Cost Explorer (B) is for analyzing costs, not for creating alerts.
---
Question #: 300
What are the two primary components that determine the cost of running an AWS Lambda function? (Choose TWO)

A. The number of times the function is invoked (requests).
B. The amount of memory allocated to the function.
C. The amount of outbound data transfer.
D. The duration of the function's execution.
E. The number of vCPUs allocated to the function.

Answer: A, D

Explanation: The AWS Lambda pricing model is based on two main factors: the number of requests made to your function (A) and the total compute time, measured in gigabyte-seconds (GB-seconds) (D). The GB-second calculation is a combination of the memory you allocate (B) and the duration of the execution. While data transfer (C) has a cost, it's a separate charge and not part of the primary Lambda pricing model.
---
Question #: 301
A company wants to analyze its AWS spending over the last 12 months, group the costs by service, and visualize the trends. Which tool is best suited for this ad-hoc analysis?

A. The AWS Bills page
B. AWS Budgets
C. AWS Cost Explorer
D. Amazon QuickSight

Answer: C

Explanation: AWS Cost Explorer is the primary tool for visualizing, understanding, and managing your AWS costs and usage over time. It provides a default report that breaks down costs by service and allows you to create custom reports with advanced filtering and grouping capabilities to analyze historical data and forecast future spending.
---
Question #: 302
An image processing application is built using a serverless architecture. When a user uploads an image to an S3 bucket, a thumbnail needs to be created. What is the most cost-effective and scalable way to trigger this process?

A. An EC2 instance that constantly polls the S3 bucket for new images.
B. A scheduled AWS Lambda function that runs every minute to check for new images.
C. An S3 Event Notification that directly invokes an AWS Lambda function.
D. A CloudWatch alarm that triggers when the bucket size increases.

Answer: C

Explanation: S3 Event Notifications provide a push-based, event-driven mechanism. This is the most efficient and serverless approach. The Lambda function is only invoked (and you only pay for compute) when a new object is actually created, eliminating the need for polling and ensuring the process scales automatically with the number of uploads.
---
Question #: 303
A company has implemented a "serverless" architecture using Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB. What is a key cost benefit of this model compared to a traditional server-based architecture?

A. Data transfer costs are eliminated.
B. They do not pay for idle compute resources.
C. Software licensing costs are always lower.
D. Reserved Instances can be used for Lambda.

Answer: B

Explanation: The core principle of the serverless pay-per-use model is that you are not charged when your code isn't running. In a traditional model with EC2, you pay for the instance as long as it's running, even if it's sitting idle waiting for requests. With serverless, you only incur costs for the actual requests served and the compute time consumed, which can be extremely cost-effective for applications with variable or intermittent traffic.
---
Question #: 304
A company uses several AWS accounts under AWS Organizations. They need to get a consolidated view of the costs and usage for all member accounts. Where can they view this information?

A. In each member account's billing dashboard.
B. In the management account's billing dashboard, if consolidated billing is enabled.
C. In a special "logging" account.
D. In the AWS Service Catalog.

Answer: B

Explanation: A key feature of AWS Organizations is consolidated billing. All charges from the member accounts are rolled up to the management account. The management account's billing dashboard and Cost Explorer will then show a combined view of all charges, and can also be used to view the costs broken down by individual member account.

Question #: 305
A Lambda function is configured with 512 MB of memory. It runs for 500 milliseconds for each invocation. In a month, it is invoked 2 million times. How is the compute duration cost calculated?

A. Based on 2 million requests.
B. Based on the total GB-seconds consumed: (512 MB / 1024 MB/GB) * (500 ms / 1000 ms/s) * 2,000,000 invocations.
C. Based on the total execution time in seconds: 500 ms * 2,000,000.
D. There is no charge for duration, only for requests.

Answer: B

Explanation: The Lambda compute charge is based on GB-seconds. To calculate this, you normalize the memory to GB (512MB = 0.5 GB), normalize the duration to seconds (500ms = 0.5 s), and multiply by the number of invocations. The total GB-seconds would be 0.5 GB * 0.5 s * 2,000,000 = 500,000 GB-seconds. This amount (minus any free tier) is then multiplied by the GB-second price.

Question #: 306
A company wants to track the costs of a specific project that involves resources across multiple services (EC2, S3, RDS). What is the most effective way to group and report on these specific project-related costs?

A. Create a separate AWS account for the project.
B. Apply a consistent "project" cost allocation tag to all resources associated with the project.
C. Use the service name to filter costs in Cost Explorer.
D. Create a separate budget for each service used by the project.

Answer: B

Explanation: Cost allocation tags are the primary mechanism for organizing your AWS costs along business dimensions. By consistently applying a tag (e.g., a key of `project-name` and a value of `phoenix`) to all the resources, you can then activate that tag in the billing console. This allows you to filter and group by that tag in Cost Explorer and other reports, giving you a clear view of the total cost for that specific project.
---
Question #: 307
An API built with API Gateway and Lambda is experiencing high latency. The logs show that many Lambda invocations are experiencing a "cold start". What does this mean?

A. The Lambda function's code has a bug that causes it to start slowly.
B. The Lambda service is down in that region.
C. AWS is starting up a new execution environment for the function, which includes loading the code and initializing the runtime.
D. The API Gateway is throttling the requests to Lambda.

Answer: C

Explanation: A "cold start" refers to the latency incurred on the first invocation of a Lambda function after a period of inactivity. AWS needs to provision a new, secure execution environment, download your code, and initialize the runtime and any libraries. Subsequent invocations can reuse this "warm" environment, resulting in much lower latency.
---
Question #: 308
A company wants to be notified if their monthly usage of S3 Standard storage exceeds 10 TB. They are not concerned about the cost, only the amount of data stored. Which AWS Budgets feature should they use?

A. A Cost Budget
B. A Usage Budget
C. A Savings Plans Budget
D. A Reserved Instance Budget

Answer: B

Explanation: AWS Budgets allows you to monitor more than just cost. A Usage Budget lets you set a threshold on a specific usage metric (e.g., "GB-Mo" for S3 Standard Storage, or "Hrs" for EC2 instances) and receive an alert when your usage exceeds that threshold, regardless of the associated cost.
---
Question #: 309
Which of the following is a characteristic of a "serverless" service on AWS?

A. It requires you to provision and manage the underlying server capacity.
B. It has a pricing model that is not based on usage.
C. It abstracts the underlying server infrastructure, allowing you to focus on application logic, and typically has a pay-per-use pricing model.
D. It can only be used for web applications.

Answer: C

Explanation: The core concepts of "serverless" are the abstraction of servers and a pay-for-value pricing model. With services like Lambda, S3, and DynamoDB, you don't see or manage any servers, and your bill is directly related to the amount of usage (invocations, storage, requests), with no charge for idle time.
---
Question #: 310
You are using the AWS Free Tier as a new customer. You launch a t2.micro EC2 instance and run it for 800 hours in a 31-day month. The free tier provides 750 hours of a t2.micro instance. How many hours will you be billed for?

A. 0 hours
B. 50 hours
C. 750 hours
D. 800 hours

Answer: B

Explanation: The AWS Free Tier provides a specific monthly allowance for certain services. In this case, you get 750 hours of a t2.micro instance for free. Since you used 800 hours, you will be billed for the usage that exceeded the free tier allowance, which is 800 - 750 = 50 hours, at the standard On-Demand rate.
---
Question #: 311
A Lambda function needs to process messages from an SQS queue. The function is designed to be highly parallel. To prevent a single function from overwhelming a downstream database, the company wants to limit the maximum number of concurrent executions of this specific function to 10. How can this be achieved?

A. By setting the `BatchSize` of the SQS event source mapping to 10.
B. By setting the "Reserved Concurrency" for the Lambda function to 10.
C. By placing the function in a VPC.
D. This is not possible; concurrency cannot be limited on a per-function basis.

Answer: B

Explanation: Reserved Concurrency is a feature that allows you to guarantee a specific maximum number of concurrent executions for a particular function. By setting the reserved concurrency to 10, you are telling the Lambda service to never allow more than 10 instances of this function to be running at the same time. This acts as a throttle to protect downstream resources.
---
Question #: 312
Which of the following services are considered "serverless"? (Choose TWO)

A. Amazon EC2
B. Amazon S3
C. Amazon RDS
D. AWS Lambda
E. A self-managed Kubernetes cluster on EC2

Answer: B, D

Explanation: Amazon S3 (B) is a serverless object storage service, and AWS Lambda (D) is a serverless compute service. With both, you don't provision or manage any servers. EC2 (A) and RDS (C) are managed services, but you still provision and manage specific instance sizes and capacities, so they are not considered serverless.
---
Question #: 313
A team is consistently overspending on their development environment. The manager wants to get a daily report of the previous day's spend for that specific environment, which is tagged with `"environment": "development"`. How can this be achieved?

A. Create a daily AWS Cost and Usage Report (CUR) delivered to S3, filtered by the tag.
B. Manually check the AWS Bills page every day.
C. Create a usage budget that alerts daily.
D. Use Cost Explorer to create a saved report filtered by the "environment" tag, and subscribe to receive daily email updates for that report.

Answer: D

Explanation: Cost Explorer has a feature that allows you to save your customized reports. You can create a report, apply a filter for the specific tag, and then use the "Share" or "Subscribe" feature to have Cost Explorer automatically email you a daily CSV file of that report's data.
---
Question #: 314
What happens if an AWS Lambda function, configured with an SQS queue as a trigger, does not have permission in its execution role to receive messages from the queue?

A. The Lambda function will still be invoked, but with an empty event payload.
B. The Lambda service will be unable to poll the queue, and the function will not be invoked. An error will be visible in the event source mapping configuration.
C. The messages will be automatically moved to the SQS Dead-Letter Queue.
D. The SQS queue will be automatically disabled.

Answer: B

Explanation: The Lambda service acts on your behalf to poll the SQS queue. To do this, it uses the function's execution role. If that role does not have the required `sqs:ReceiveMessage` and other necessary permissions, the Lambda service's polling attempts will be denied by SQS. This will prevent any messages from being delivered to your function.
---
Question #: 315
A company wants to find opportunities to save money by identifying idle or underutilized EC2 instances. Which AWS service can provide this recommendation?

A. AWS Budgets
B. AWS Cost Explorer Rightsizing Recommendations
C. Amazon CloudWatch
D. AWS CloudTrail

Answer: B

Explanation: AWS Cost Explorer includes a feature that analyzes your past EC2 usage patterns and provides rightsizing recommendations. It can identify instances that are consistently underutilized (e.g., have very low average CPU) and recommend a smaller, cheaper instance size. It can also identify idle instances that could potentially be terminated.
---
Question #: 316
An application uses API Gateway with a Lambda integration. The API is expected to receive 10 million requests per month. The Lambda function has 256 MB of memory and runs for 200 ms on average. Which service will likely represent the higher portion of the bill?

A. AWS Lambda, due to the high number of invocations.
B. Amazon API Gateway, as its per-request cost is typically higher than Lambda's.
C. The costs will be approximately equal.
D. Data transfer costs will be the highest.

Answer: B

Explanation: While Lambda's pricing is very low, API Gateway's pricing is also per-request. At the time of writing, the per-million-request price for API Gateway is significantly higher than the per-million-request price for Lambda. For a typical lightweight function like this, the API Gateway charges will usually be the larger part of the total cost.
---
Question #: 317
Which of the following is an example of a "pay-as-you-go" pricing model?

A. Purchasing a 3-year All Upfront Reserved Instance.
B. Bidding on a Spot Instance.
C. Launching an On-Demand EC2 instance and paying by the second for the time it runs.
D. Committing to a 1-year Savings Plan.

Answer: C

Explanation: The pay-as-you-go model, exemplified by On-Demand pricing, means you pay only for the resources you actually consume, for the duration you consume them, with no long-term commitments or upfront payments. This provides the most flexibility. The other options all involve some form of commitment or bidding.
---
Question #: 318
A Lambda function needs to store a small amount of state between invocations (e.g., a session counter). The function scales to hundreds of concurrent executions. What is the most appropriate and scalable place to store this state?

A. A global variable within the Lambda function code.
B. The `/tmp` directory of the Lambda execution environment.
C. An external, shared data store like Amazon DynamoDB.
D. An EBS volume attached to the Lambda function.

Answer: C

Explanation: Lambda execution environments are stateless and ephemeral. A global variable (A) or the `/tmp` directory (B) is local to a single concurrent execution and will be lost. To share state across all concurrent executions of a function, you must use an external, durable storage service. DynamoDB is a perfect choice as it is also serverless and provides the low-latency key-value access needed for session state.
---
Question #: 319
What is the primary purpose of "cost allocation tags"?

A. To apply security controls to resources.
B. To identify and group AWS costs by business dimensions, such as project, department, or cost center.
C. To trigger automated actions when a resource is created.
D. To define the performance characteristics of a resource.

Answer: B

Explanation: Cost allocation tags are metadata that you can assign to your AWS resources. After you activate these tags in the AWS Billing console, you can use them in tools like Cost Explorer and the Cost and Usage Report to categorize and track your AWS costs along the lines of your business structure, making it easier to perform internal chargebacks and understand spending.
---
Question #: 320
A company is building a serverless backend for a mobile app. The backend needs to expose a secure, scalable REST API that can trigger different Lambda functions based on the URL path and HTTP method. Which service should be used to create and manage this API?

A. Elastic Load Balancer
B. Amazon S3
C. Amazon API Gateway
D. AWS AppSync

Answer: C

Explanation: Amazon API Gateway is the fully managed service for creating, publishing, maintaining, and securing APIs at any scale. It integrates natively with AWS Lambda, allowing you to easily build serverless backends where different API endpoints (`/users`, `/orders`) and methods (`GET`, `POST`) can be routed to specific Lambda functions for processing.
---
Question #: 321
A company has a monthly AWS budget of $5,000. They want to take an automatic action to prevent overspending if the forecasted cost reaches 100% of the budget. What action can an AWS Budget be configured to take directly?

A. Terminate all EC2 instances in the account.
B. Apply a restrictive IAM policy to a user or role to prevent them from creating new resources.
C. Automatically purchase Reserved Instances to lower the cost.
D. Send an email to the finance department.

Answer: B

Explanation: AWS Budgets Actions allow you to configure automated responses when a budget threshold is exceeded. A common action is to attach a pre-defined IAM policy (such as a read-only policy) to a specific user, group, or role. This can effectively stop that principal from incurring any further costs by preventing them from launching new resources.
---
Question #: 322
What is the AWS Lambda "execution environment"?

A. The IAM role that the function assumes.
B. The S3 bucket where the function's code is stored.
C. A secure and isolated runtime environment where your Lambda function code is executed.
D. The VPC that the function is connected to.

Answer: C

Explanation: The execution environment is the temporary, container-like environment that the Lambda service provisions to run your code. It includes the necessary OS, language runtime, and any libraries, and it is where your function's handler is invoked. AWS manages the lifecycle of these environments.
---
Question #: 323
You need to analyze your AWS costs with a very high level of detail, including resource-level data like the instance ID of an EC2 instance or the bucket name of S3 storage. Which tool provides this level of granularity?

A. AWS Budgets
B. AWS Cost Explorer
C. The AWS Bills page
D. The AWS Cost and Usage Report (CUR)

Answer: D

Explanation: The AWS Cost and Usage Report (CUR) is the most comprehensive and granular source of billing data. It provides detailed, line-item data for every single charge incurred, including resource IDs, pricing details, and any applied discounts. The report is delivered to an S3 bucket, where it can be analyzed with tools like Athena or QuickSight.
---
Question #: 324
A serverless application needs to orchestrate a workflow that involves several Lambda functions, some of which need to run in parallel, and includes wait states and conditional logic. What is the best AWS service to manage this workflow?

A. A "controller" Lambda function that invokes the other functions.
B. An SQS queue to pass messages between the functions.
C. AWS Step Functions
D. Amazon SNS

Answer: C

Explanation: AWS Step Functions is the purpose-built service for orchestrating complex, multi-step serverless workflows. You can visually define your workflow as a state machine, which makes it easy to manage sequential tasks, parallel execution, branching logic, and error handling without writing complex orchestration code in a single Lambda function.
---
Question #: 325
You have a Lambda function that is part of a critical real-time API. To minimize latency, you need to reduce the number of "cold starts". What Lambda feature can help with this?

A. Increasing the function's memory.
B. Using a different programming language.
C. Configuring Provisioned Concurrency for the function.
D. Connecting the function to a VPC.

Answer: C

Explanation: Provisioned Concurrency is a feature designed to keep a specified number of execution environments "warm" and ready to respond instantly to requests. By configuring provisioned concurrency, you are telling Lambda to pre-initialize a number of environments, which effectively eliminates cold start latency for the invocations that are served by those warm environments.
---
Question #: 326
Which of the following is an example of a cost that is part of the "Data Transfer Out" category on an AWS bill?

A. Data transferred from an S3 bucket to an EC2 instance in the same region.
B. Data transferred from an EC2 instance to the public internet.
C. Data transferred between two EC2 instances in the same Availability Zone.
D. Data transferred into an S3 bucket from the internet.

Answer: B

Explanation: AWS generally does not charge for data transferred *into* its services or for data transferred between services within the same region (with some exceptions). The primary data transfer cost is for "Data Transfer Out" (DTO), which is data that leaves the AWS network and goes out to the public internet.
---
Question #: 327
A Lambda function needs to connect to an RDS database located inside a VPC. What must be configured for the Lambda function to allow this connection?

A. An IAM role with `rds-connect` permissions.
B. The Lambda function must be configured to run inside the VPC.
C. An Internet Gateway must be attached to the VPC.
D. The RDS database must have a public IP address.

Answer: B

Explanation: To access resources within a VPC, such as an RDS database, the Lambda function's execution environment must be attached to that VPC. This involves configuring the function with the VPC's ID, subnet IDs, and a security group. This will create an Elastic Network Interface (ENI) in your subnet, allowing the function to communicate with other resources in the VPC using their private IP addresses.
---
Question #: 328
A company has a number of small, independent AWS accounts for its development teams. What is a key cost benefit of consolidating these accounts into a single AWS Organization?

A. It provides a separate bill for each account.
B. It allows the aggregate usage of all accounts to qualify for volume pricing tiers for services like S3 and data transfer.
C. It eliminates all data transfer costs between the accounts.
D. It provides a 10% discount on the total bill.

Answer: B

Explanation: Many AWS services have tiered pricing, where the per-unit cost decreases as your usage increases. With consolidated billing in an AWS Organization, AWS combines the usage from all member accounts when calculating the bill. This means the total, aggregated usage is more likely to reach the higher-volume, lower-priced tiers, which can result in a lower overall bill for the entire organization.
---
Question #: 329
What is the primary factor that determines the cost of using Amazon API Gateway?

A. The amount of memory used by the backend integration.
B. The number of API calls received, plus the amount of data transferred out.
C. The number of active connections to the API.
D. A fixed monthly fee per API.

Answer: B

Explanation: The pricing for Amazon API Gateway is primarily based on two factors: the number of API requests your API receives and the amount of data that is transferred out to your clients. There is no charge for idle time and no minimum fee.
---
Question #: 330
A Lambda function, triggered asynchronously by an S3 event, fails all of its retry attempts. To avoid losing the failed event, what should be configured on the function?

A. Increase the function's timeout.
B. Configure a Dead-Letter Queue (DLQ), such as an SQS queue or an SNS topic.
C. Increase the function's memory.
D. Manually re-upload the file to S3.

Answer: B

Explanation: A Dead-Letter Queue (DLQ) is the standard mechanism for handling persistent failures in asynchronous, event-driven systems. By configuring a DLQ for your Lambda function, you are telling the Lambda service that if an asynchronous invocation fails all of its retries, the original event payload should be sent to the specified SQS queue or SNS topic for later analysis and debugging.
---
Question #: 331
A company is trying to understand which business unit is responsible for a sudden spike in their S3 costs. All resources are tagged with a "BusinessUnit" tag. What is the most effective way to investigate?

A. Open a support case with AWS.
B. Use AWS Cost Explorer and group the S3 costs by the "BusinessUnit" tag.
C. Analyze the S3 server access logs.
D. Use the AWS Budgets report.

Answer: B

Explanation: This is a prime use case for Cost Explorer combined with cost allocation tags. By filtering the view to show only the S3 service, and then grouping the costs by the "BusinessUnit" tag, you can quickly get a visual breakdown of S3 spending by business unit, which will immediately identify which unit is responsible for the cost spike.
---
Question #: 332
In a serverless architecture, which service is typically used to decouple a producer of events (like a microservice that creates orders) from the consumers of those events (like shipping and invoicing services)?

A. An Application Load Balancer
B. An EC2 instance
C. An event bus like Amazon EventBridge or a message queue like Amazon SQS.
D. A direct, synchronous API call.

Answer: C

Explanation: Decoupling is a core principle of robust serverless design. Using an event bus (EventBridge) or a message queue (SQS) as an intermediary allows the producer to simply publish an event without needing to know anything about the consumers. This allows the consumer services to be scaled, updated, or even fail independently without affecting the producer.
---
Question #: 333
A Lambda function is configured to connect to a VPC to access an ElastiCache cluster. However, the function also needs to access a public third-party API over the internet. What is required in the VPC for this to work?

A. An Internet Gateway and a route in the public subnet's route table.
B. The Lambda function needs to be in a private subnet, and the VPC must have a NAT Gateway in a public subnet with a corresponding route.
C. An Elastic IP address attached to the Lambda function.
D. A VPC Peering connection.

Answer: B

Explanation: When you place a Lambda function in a VPC, it loses its default internet access. To allow it to access public endpoints, you must provide a path to the internet. The standard, secure way to do this is to place the function's ENI in a private subnet and configure that subnet's route table to direct internet-bound traffic (0.0.0.0/0) to a NAT Gateway located in a public subnet.
---
Question #: 334
What is the purpose of the AWS Cost and Usage Report (CUR)?

A. To provide real-time alerts when costs exceed a budget.
B. To provide a high-level summary of your monthly bill.
C. To provide the most comprehensive and granular raw data about your AWS costs and usage, delivered to an S3 bucket.
D. To provide recommendations for cost savings.

Answer: C

Explanation: The CUR is the single source of truth for all billing data. It is a detailed, machine-readable report that contains line-item level information about every charge. It is designed to be ingested by business intelligence tools like Amazon Athena and QuickSight, or third-party cost management platforms, for detailed analysis.
---
Question #: 335
What is the maximum execution duration for a single AWS Lambda invocation?

A. 60 seconds
B. 5 minutes (300 seconds)
C. 15 minutes (900 seconds)
D. 1 hour

Answer: C

Explanation: The maximum configurable timeout for a Lambda function is 15 minutes (900 seconds). If your function's execution exceeds this timeout, the Lambda service will terminate the execution environment. This makes Lambda suitable for short-to-medium duration tasks, but not for very long-running batch jobs.
---
Question #: 336
A company wants to identify which IAM user is responsible for launching a large, expensive EC2 instance that caused a cost spike. Which service would provide this audit trail?

A. AWS Cost Explorer
B. Amazon CloudWatch
C. AWS CloudTrail
D. AWS Config

Answer: C

Explanation: AWS CloudTrail records all API calls made in your account. To find who launched an instance, you would search your CloudTrail event history for the `RunInstances` event. The log entry for that event will contain the IAM user identity that made the API call, along with the timestamp and source IP address.
---
Question #: 337
An application uses DynamoDB in On-Demand capacity mode. What is the primary benefit of this mode?

A. It provides a lower cost for predictable, steady-state workloads.
B. It eliminates the need for capacity planning and automatically scales to handle the workload, with a pay-per-request model.
C. It allows for strongly consistent reads across multiple regions.
D. It reserves a specific amount of throughput for the table.

Answer: B

Explanation: On-Demand mode is the serverless, hands-off approach to DynamoDB capacity management. You don't have to forecast your read/write needs or manage provisioned throughput settings. DynamoDB handles all the scaling for you, making it ideal for new applications, applications with unpredictable traffic, or development environments.
---
Question #: 338
A team wants to experiment with a new serverless application without risking a large, unexpected bill. What is a good first step to control costs?

A. Purchase a Savings Plan for their anticipated usage.
B. Create a cost budget in AWS Budgets with an alert threshold set at a low dollar amount (e.g., $50).
C. Use only the smallest possible Lambda memory configuration.
D. Only deploy the application in a single Availability Zone.

Answer: B

Explanation: AWS Budgets is the primary tool for proactive cost control. By setting up a budget with a low threshold and an alert, the team will be notified as soon as their spending starts to ramp up. This allows them to investigate and shut down resources if necessary, before the costs become significant.
---
Question #: 339
Which of the following describes the pricing model of Amazon SQS?

A. A fixed monthly fee per queue.
B. Based on the number of EC2 instances polling the queue.
C. Based on the number of requests made to the queue and the amount of data transferred.
D. Based on the duration that messages are stored in the queue.

Answer: C

Explanation: Like many serverless services, SQS has a pay-per-use model. You are primarily charged based on the number of requests you make (e.g., SendMessage, ReceiveMessage, DeleteMessage). Standard queues are billed per 64 KB chunk of data in each request. There are also charges for data transfer out of AWS.
---
Question #: 340
A Lambda function, written in Python, has a dependency on a large third-party library. What is the recommended way to manage this dependency to optimize performance?

A. Install the library in the `/tmp` space during the function's initialization.
B. Package the library with the function code in a .zip file, but separate it into a Lambda Layer.
C. Download the library from the internet on every invocation.
D. Store the library in an S3 bucket and have the function download it.

Answer: B

Explanation: Lambda Layers are a mechanism for managing and sharing common dependencies. By packaging your large libraries into a layer, you can keep your function's deployment package small. This can speed up deployments and, more importantly, can help reduce cold start times because the layer's code can be cached and reused by the execution environment.
---
Question #: 341
What are "Cost Categories" in the AWS Billing and Cost Management console?

A. A way to create custom categories and rules to organize your costs based on your business needs (e.g., grouping accounts or tags into a "Team A" category).
B. The default service categories used by AWS, such as "Compute", "Storage", and "Database".
C. A list of all the services you are using that are eligible for the Free Tier.
D. A way to categorize your spending by payment method.

Answer: A

Explanation: AWS Cost Categories is a feature that allows you to create your own custom groupings for your cost and usage information. You can create rules to map costs from specific accounts, tags, or even other cost categories into a meaningful structure that aligns with your business, such as teams, departments, or applications.
---
Question #: 342
A serverless application needs to send the same notification to a Lambda function, an SQS queue, and an email address. Which service is designed for this "fan-out" messaging?

A. Amazon SQS
B. Amazon EventBridge
C. Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service)
D. AWS Step Functions

Answer: C

Explanation: The classic fan-out pattern is the primary use case for Amazon SNS. You publish a single message to an SNS topic. The topic then delivers a copy of that message to all of its subscribers, which can be a mix of different types like Lambda, SQS, email, and HTTPS endpoints.
---
Question #: 343
What is the primary factor you are billed for when using Amazon S3 storage?

A. The number of objects stored.
B. The amount of storage consumed (in GB-months).
C. The number of buckets in your account.
D. The amount of CPU used to retrieve objects.

Answer: B

Explanation: While there are other charges (for requests, data transfer, etc.), the main and usually largest component of an S3 bill is the charge for the amount of data you are storing. This is calculated in Gigabyte-Months, which represents the average amount of storage used throughout the month.
---
Question #: 344
A developer is writing a Lambda function that will be triggered by an API Gateway. The function needs to return a response to the client within 2 seconds. What invocation model is being used?

A. Asynchronous invocation
B. Stream-based invocation
C. Scheduled invocation
D. Synchronous (Request-Response) invocation

Answer: D

Explanation: When a Lambda function is invoked by API Gateway (for a standard API), it is a synchronous, or request-response, invocation. API Gateway invokes the function and then waits for the function to complete and return a response. It then passes that response back to the original client.
---
Question #: 345
A company is using AWS Organizations. They want to prevent any user in a specific member account (designated for training) from launching any EC2 instances that are not in the t2 or t3 family to control costs. What is the most effective way to enforce this?

A. An IAM policy applied to all users in the member account.
B. A Service Control Policy (SCP) attached to the member account in the AWS Organizations console.
C. An AWS Budget action.
D. A cron job that terminates non-compliant instances.

Answer: B

Explanation: A Service Control Policy (SCP) is the best tool for creating preventative guardrails. An SCP attached to an account or OU can set the maximum permissions available. You could create an SCP that denies the `ec2:RunInstances` action if the request specifies an instance type that is not `t2.*` or `t3.*`. This policy would be enforced for all users and roles in the account, including its root user.
---
Question #: 346
Which of the following is a potential disadvantage of a purely serverless architecture?

A. It is less scalable than a server-based architecture.
B. It can be difficult to manage dependencies and orchestrate complex workflows without the right tools.
C. You are responsible for patching the underlying operating system.
D. It has a higher cost for idle resources.

Answer: B

Explanation: While powerful, serverless architectures introduce new complexities. A complex application might be broken down into dozens or hundreds of small functions. Managing the dependencies between these functions, handling state, and orchestrating complex business logic can become challenging, which is why services like AWS Step Functions are often used to manage the workflow.
---
Question #: 347
What does the "memory (RAM)" setting for a Lambda function also control?

A. The amount of temporary disk space (`/tmp`) available to the function.
B. The amount of CPU power and network bandwidth allocated to the function.
C. The maximum number of concurrent executions.
D. The pricing for data transfer.

Answer: B

Explanation: In AWS Lambda, the memory setting is the primary lever for controlling performance. AWS allocates CPU power and network bandwidth proportionally to the amount of memory you configure. If your function is CPU-bound or network-bound, increasing its memory allocation (even if it doesn't need the extra RAM) will also give it more processing power and can reduce its execution time.
---
Question #: 348
A company wants to get a high-level overview of their AWS costs, as well as specific recommendations on how to save money by terminating idle resources or purchasing Reserved Instances. Which service provides both a cost overview and actionable recommendations?

A. AWS Budgets
B. AWS Cost Explorer
C. The AWS Bills page
D. AWS Trusted Advisor

Answer: D

Explanation: AWS Trusted Advisor acts as an automated cloud expert. It inspects your AWS environment and makes recommendations based on best practices across several categories, including a "Cost Optimization" category. This is where you will find specific, actionable recommendations like identifying idle RDS instances, underutilized EC2 instances, and recommendations for RI or Savings Plan purchases. Cost Explorer (B) also has some recommendations, but Trusted Advisor is the primary service for this.
---
Question #: 349
What is the pricing model for AWS Step Functions?

A. A fixed monthly fee per state machine.
B. Based on the number of state transitions that occur during your executions.
C. Based on the amount of memory consumed by the executions.
D. Based on the number of Lambda functions orchestrated.

Answer: B

Explanation: AWS Step Functions has a serverless, pay-per-use pricing model. You are charged for each state transition that your state machine executes. For example, a simple workflow that goes from a Start state, to a Task state, and then to an End state would involve 3 state transitions.

Question #: 350
A company has a serverless application that uses S3, Lambda, and DynamoDB. They notice their bill is higher than expected. What is the FIRST step they should take to understand the costs?

A. Open a support case with AWS.
B. Purchase a Savings Plan to reduce the cost.
C. Use AWS Cost Explorer to filter by service (S3, Lambda, DynamoDB) and usage type to identify which service and which specific usage is driving the cost.
D. Terminate the application immediately.

Answer: C

Explanation: Before you can optimize costs, you must understand them. AWS Cost Explorer is the primary tool for this. The first step is to use its filtering capabilities to drill down into the details. By filtering by service, you can see if the spike is from S3, Lambda, or DynamoDB. You can then group by "Usage Type" to see the specific driver (e.g., `S3: PutObject`, `Lambda: GB-Seconds`, `DynamoDB: WriteCapacityUnits`).

Question #: 351
A Lambda function needs to be invoked every hour to perform a cleanup task. What is the most appropriate, serverless way to trigger this function?

A. An EC2 instance with a cron job that calls the Lambda API every hour.
B. An Amazon EventBridge (CloudWatch Events) rule with a schedule expression (e.g., `rate(1 hour)`).
C. A continuous loop within the Lambda function with a 1-hour sleep timer.
D. An SNS topic that you manually publish to every hour.

Answer: B

Explanation: Amazon EventBridge is the serverless scheduler for AWS. You can create a rule that runs on a fixed schedule (either a rate or a cron expression) and set its target to be your Lambda function. This is highly reliable, cost-effective, and fully managed.

Question #: 352
Which of the following would be included in the AWS Free Tier for a new account? (Choose TWO)

A. A certain number of EC2 On-Demand hours per month.
B. A certain number of Amazon S3 `GetObject` requests per month.
C. Unlimited data transfer out to the internet.
D. A free 3-year Reserved Instance.
E. A certain number of AWS Lambda invocations per month.

Answer: A, B, E

Explanation: The AWS Free Tier includes a monthly allowance for many services for the first 12 months. This typically includes a number of hours for a small EC2 instance (A), a certain amount of S3 storage and requests (B), and a number of Lambda invocations and compute duration (E). It does not include unlimited data transfer or free RIs.
---
Question #: 353
A company wants to tag its resources so that costs can be allocated to different departments. A developer forgets to tag a new EC2 instance. What is a consequence of this?

A. The instance will not be able to connect to the network.
B. The cost of that instance will be grouped into the "untagged" or "unallocated" category in the cost reports.
C. The instance will be automatically terminated.
D. The instance will be billed to the management account directly.

Answer: B

Explanation: For cost allocation tagging to be effective, it must be applied consistently. Any resource that is not tagged (or not tagged with the activated cost allocation key) will have its costs appear in a generic "untagged" bucket in your Cost Explorer reports, making it difficult to attribute that spending to a specific department or project.
---
Question #: 354
Which of the following is NOT a serverless service?

A. AWS Lambda
B. Amazon S3
C. Amazon DynamoDB
D. Amazon RDS

Answer: D

Explanation: Amazon RDS is a managed database service, but it is not serverless. You must provision a specific database instance type (e.g., `db.m5.large`), manage its storage capacity, and configure scaling. You pay for the instance as long as it is running, regardless of the number of queries it is serving. The other services are all serverless.
---
Question #: 355
A Lambda function, triggered by API Gateway, needs to access a secret stored in AWS Secrets Manager. What is the most secure and cost-effective way for the function to get this secret?

A. Hardcode the secret directly in the Lambda function's code.
B. Store the secret in an S3 bucket and have the function read the file.
C. Give the function's execution role IAM permission to call the `GetSecretValue` API for the specific secret, and have the function retrieve it at runtime.
D. Pass the secret as a parameter in the API Gateway request.

Answer: C

Explanation: This is the secure and standard pattern. The secret is stored and encrypted in Secrets Manager. The Lambda function's IAM role grants it the specific, least-privilege permission to read that one secret. This avoids hardcoding credentials, provides an audit trail via CloudTrail, and allows the secret to be rotated without changing the function's code.
---
Question #: 356
A company has a monthly budget of $2,000. Their actual spend for the month is $1,500, but their forecasted spend is $2,200. Can an AWS Budget alert be triggered?

A. No, alerts can only be triggered on actual costs.
B. No, alerts can only be triggered when the actual cost exceeds the budget.
C. Yes, a budget alert can be configured to trigger when the forecasted cost exceeds the budget threshold.
D. Yes, but only if you are using AWS Organizations.

Answer: C

Explanation: AWS Budgets can be configured to track your spending against a threshold based on either your actual, accrued costs so far in the month, or based on a forecast of what your total spend for the month will be. Alerting on the forecast allows you to be notified of a potential overspend early in the month, giving you time to take corrective action.
---
Question #: 357
What is a key benefit of building an application using a "microservices" architecture with serverless components like Lambda?

A. It reduces the complexity of the application.
B. It allows individual components of the application to be developed, deployed, and scaled independently, and can lead to cost savings.
C. It eliminates the need for an API layer.
D. It guarantees that the application will have lower latency.

Answer: B

Explanation: A serverless microservices architecture breaks a large application down into small, independent services (often, a single Lambda function represents a microservice). This decoupling means that teams can work on different services in parallel. You can scale one specific service that is under high load (e.g., the "add-to-cart" service) without having to scale the entire application, which is a very efficient and cost-effective scaling model.
---
Question #: 358
A company wants to track its RI and Savings Plan coverage to ensure they are getting the most out of their commitments. Which tool should they use?

A. AWS CloudTrail
B. The AWS Bills page
C. AWS Cost Explorer's coverage reports
D. AWS Trusted Advisor

Answer: C

Explanation: AWS Cost Explorer provides specific reports for analyzing your commitments. The "RI Coverage" and "Savings Plans Coverage" reports show you what percentage of your overall instance usage was covered by a discounted pricing model, versus what percentage was billed at the more expensive On-Demand rate. This helps you identify gaps where you could purchase more reservations to increase your savings.
---
Question #: 359
Which of the following is a direct cost associated with using an S3 bucket? (Choose TWO)

A. The number of IAM users with access to the bucket.
B. The amount of data stored in the bucket (GB-months).
C. The number of PUT, GET, and other requests made to the bucket.
D. The size of the EC2 instance used to access the bucket.
E. The number of security policies attached to the bucket.

Answer: B, C

Explanation: The primary costs for S3 are for the storage itself (B) and for the requests made against your data (C). Other costs can include data transfer, and charges for features like S3 Intelligent-Tiering monitoring, but storage and requests are the core components.
---
Question #: 360
A Lambda function has a memory setting of 128 MB. The code is CPU-intensive and is taking a long time to execute, increasing costs. What is a likely way to REDUCE the overall cost of this function?

A. Decrease the memory to the minimum possible value.
B. Increase the memory allocation (e.g., to 256 MB or 512 MB) to provide more proportional CPU power, which could decrease the execution time significantly.
C. Change the function's timeout to a lower value.
D. Rewrite the function in a different programming language.

Answer: B

Explanation: This is a common cost optimization pattern for CPU-bound Lambda functions. Because CPU is allocated proportionally to memory, increasing the memory can drastically reduce the execution time. Even though the per-millisecond cost is higher for a larger memory size, the reduction in duration is often so large that the overall GB-second cost (and your bill) decreases. You should experiment to find the optimal price/performance point.
---
Question #: 361
A company wants to create a dashboard to visualize key cost and usage metrics, such as their top 5 cost-incurring services and their daily EC2 running hours. Which tool should they use to build this custom dashboard?

A. AWS Budgets
B. The AWS Bills page
C. AWS Cost Explorer
D. Amazon CloudWatch

Answer: D

Explanation: While Cost Explorer is used for analysis, Amazon CloudWatch is the service for creating custom operational and monitoring dashboards. You can add widgets to a CloudWatch dashboard that display billing metrics from the `AWS/Billing` namespace, allowing you to create a customized "single pane of glass" view of your most important cost metrics alongside your performance metrics.
---
Question #: 362
An event-driven architecture is designed where a new user signing up publishes an event. This single event needs to trigger three different processes: sending a welcome email, adding the user to a marketing list, and provisioning a new account. What is the most decoupled and scalable way to design this?

A. Have the user signup service make three direct API calls to the other services.
B. Have the signup service publish a single event to an SNS topic, with each of the three downstream processes subscribed via SQS queues or Lambda functions.
C. Have the signup service write a record to a DynamoDB table, which is then scanned by the other services.
D. Use a single Lambda function to perform all three tasks.

Answer: B

Explanation: The SNS fan-out pattern is the ideal solution. The signup service's only responsibility is to publish a single, generic "user_created" event. The downstream services can then subscribe to this event and act on it independently. This decouples the services, allowing them to be developed, scaled, and fail independently of each other and the original signup service.
---
Question #: 363
What is the primary pricing dimension for Amazon DynamoDB when used in On-Demand mode?

A. A fixed cost per table per hour.
B. The amount of storage consumed.
C. The number of Read Request Units and Write Request Units consumed.
D. The amount of CPU and memory allocated to the table.

Answer: C

Explanation: In On-Demand mode, DynamoDB billing is based on the actual traffic your application generates. You are billed for the number of "Read Request Units" (for reads) and "Write Request Units" (for writes, updates, and deletes) that your application performs. Storage is a separate, smaller cost component.
---
Question #: 364
A Lambda function is configured with a timeout of 10 seconds. An invocation of the function takes 12 seconds to run. What happens?

A. The function completes its execution, and you are billed for 12 seconds.
B. The Lambda service terminates the execution environment after 10 seconds, and the invocation is logged as a timeout error.
C. The timeout is automatically extended to 15 seconds.
D. The function is automatically retried.

Answer: B

Explanation: The function timeout is a hard limit. If your code's execution time exceeds the configured timeout value, the Lambda service will forcibly terminate the execution. The function will return an error, and the logs will indicate that the task timed out.
---
Question #: 365
A company wants to view their AWS costs broken down by a custom business category that they define, such as "Shared Infrastructure". This category should include costs from multiple specific AWS accounts and also costs from resources with a specific tag. Which AWS Billing feature allows for this kind of custom grouping?

A. Cost Allocation Tags
B. AWS Budgets
C. AWS Cost Categories
D. Consolidated Billing

Answer: C

Explanation: AWS Cost Categories is the feature that lets you create your own custom, hierarchical groupings. You can define a category (like "Shared Infrastructure") and then write rules to map costs into that category. These rules can be based on accounts, tags, services, or even other Cost Categories, giving you a powerful way to organize your costs to match your business structure.
---
Question #: 366
What is a key architectural advantage of using serverless services like S3 and Lambda?

A. They provide you with root access to the underlying servers for customization.
B. They have built-in high availability and fault tolerance, reducing the need for you to design for it at the infrastructure level.
C. They are always cheaper than using EC2 instances.
D. They can only be deployed using the AWS Management Console.

Answer: B

Explanation: Serverless services like S3, Lambda, and DynamoDB are designed to be highly available and fault-tolerant by default. For example, S3 stores data across multiple AZs. The Lambda service runs your functions across multiple AZs. This means you inherit a significant amount of resilience without having to explicitly design and manage a multi-AZ infrastructure yourself.
---
Question #: 367
A company uses AWS Organizations and has enabled consolidated billing. Where will the AWS Free Tier usage be applied?

A. It will be applied to each member account individually.
B. It will be applied to the management account only.
C. The usage from all accounts is combined, and the Free Tier is applied once to the total aggregated usage.
D. The Free Tier is disabled when using AWS Organizations.

Answer: C

Explanation: For services that have a Free Tier, AWS treats all the accounts in an organization as a single account for billing purposes. The usage from all accounts is aggregated, and then the single Free Tier allowance is applied to that total. This means you don't get a separate Free Tier for each account in the organization.
---
Question #: 368
You are designing a serverless application that ingests data. The data must be processed in the exact order it is received, and there can be no duplicate processing. Which service should be used to queue the data before it is processed by a Lambda function?

A. Amazon SNS Standard Topic
B. Amazon SQS Standard Queue
C. Amazon SQS FIFO Queue
D. Amazon Kinesis Data Stream

Answer: C

Explanation: The requirements for strict ordering and exactly-once processing point directly to an SQS FIFO (First-In, First-Out) queue. It is specifically designed to guarantee the order of messages within a message group and to prevent duplicate messages from being processed.
---
Question #: 369
What does the "AWS Compute Optimizer" service do?

A. It provides discounts on your EC2 and Lambda usage.
B. It automatically changes your EC2 instance types to a cheaper option.
C. It analyzes the configuration and utilization metrics of your resources (like EC2, EBS, Lambda) and generates recommendations to right-size them for improved performance and lower cost.
D. It is a tool for compiling code to run more efficiently on AWS infrastructure.

Answer: C

Explanation: AWS Compute Optimizer is a recommendation engine. It uses machine learning to analyze your past utilization data and recommend optimal AWS resource configurations. For example, it might recommend changing an EC2 instance type, modifying Auto Scaling group settings, or adjusting a Lambda function's memory size to reduce costs and improve performance.
---
Question #: 370
A Lambda function, invoked asynchronously, fails all of its retries. It has both a Dead-Letter Queue (DLQ) and an "On-failure" Lambda Destination configured. Where will the failed event be sent?

A. To both the DLQ and the Destination.
B. To the DLQ only.
C. To the On-failure Destination only.
D. To neither; the event will be dropped.

Answer: C

Explanation: Lambda Destinations are the newer, more flexible way to handle invocation results. If both a DLQ and an On-failure Destination are configured on a function, the Destination takes precedence. The failed event will be sent to the resource configured in the Destination, and the DLQ will not be used.
---
Question #: 371
A company wants to track its usage of Standard Reserved Instances to make sure they are not paying for resources they are not using. Which metric should they monitor?

A. CPU Utilization
B. RI Utilization
C. Network In/Out
D. On-Demand Instance Count

Answer: B

Explanation: The RI Utilization report in AWS Cost Explorer is the key tool for this. It shows you, as a percentage, how many of your purchased RI hours were actually used by a matching instance. A low utilization percentage indicates that you are paying for RIs that are not being used, which is a waste of money.
---
Question #: 372
In a serverless API built with API Gateway and Lambda, where is the best place to handle user authentication and authorization?

A. In the code of every individual Lambda function.
B. In the API Gateway layer, using a Lambda authorizer or a Cognito user pool authorizer.
C. In the client-side application before it makes the API call.
D. In a shared library that is packaged with every Lambda function.

Answer: B

Explanation: Handling security at the entry point of your application is a best practice. API Gateway provides built-in authorizers that can validate a user's identity (e.g., by checking a token) *before* the request is ever passed to your backend Lambda function. This centralizes your security logic and ensures that your functions are only invoked by authenticated and authorized clients.
---
Question #: 373
What is the primary cost associated with AWS Step Functions?

A. A monthly fee per state machine.
B. The amount of data passed between states.
C. The number of state transitions executed.
D. The compute time of the entire execution.

Answer: C

Explanation: The pricing model for Step Functions is based on the number of state changes that occur in your workflow executions. Every time your workflow moves from one state to another, it counts as one transition, and you are billed for the total number of transitions across all your executions.
---
Question #: 374
A company has a serverless application that reads and writes to a DynamoDB table. The traffic is extremely unpredictable, with long idle periods followed by massive, sudden spikes. Which DynamoDB capacity mode is the most cost-effective and appropriate?

A. Provisioned Capacity, with a high number of RCUs and WCUs.
B. Provisioned Capacity, with an Auto Scaling policy.
C. On-Demand Capacity.
D. A DAX cluster in front of a provisioned table.

Answer: C

Explanation: On-Demand capacity is the perfect fit for unpredictable, spiky workloads. It eliminates the need to provision capacity in advance. DynamoDB will instantly scale to handle the massive spikes, and during the long idle periods, you will incur no capacity costs, only storage costs. This pay-per-request model is much more cost-effective for this pattern than trying to manage provisioned capacity.
---
Question #: 375
A Lambda function needs more than the default 512 MB of temporary storage in its `/tmp` directory. What is the solution?

A. This is a hard limit and cannot be changed.
B. Store the temporary data in an S3 bucket.
C. Configure the function with ephemeral storage, which provides a dedicated file system of up to 10 GB.
D. Attach an EBS volume to the Lambda function.

Answer: C

Explanation: AWS Lambda has a feature that allows you to configure ephemeral storage for your functions. You can provision a dedicated, writable `/tmp` directory with a size between 512 MB and 10,240 MB (10 GB). This is useful for functions that need a large amount of temporary scratch space for data processing or machine learning model loading.
---
Question #: 376
A company wants to receive an alert if their EC2 Spot Instance usage for the month exceeds $500. Which service should they use?

A. AWS Cost Explorer
B. AWS Trusted Advisor
C. Amazon CloudWatch
D. AWS Budgets

Answer: D

Explanation: AWS Budgets can be configured to track costs for very specific dimensions. You can create a cost budget and add a filter for "Purchase Option: Spot" to track only your Spot Instance spending. You can then set a threshold of $500 and an alert notification.
---
Question #: 377
Which of the following is an example of a synchronous invocation of a Lambda function?

A. An S3 bucket event triggering a function.
B. A call from an Application Load Balancer.
C. A message from an SNS topic triggering a function.
D. An Amazon EventBridge scheduled rule triggering a function.

Answer: B

Explanation: When an Application Load Balancer is configured with a Lambda function as a target, the invocation is synchronous. The ALB sends the request to the Lambda service, waits for the function to execute and return a response, and then passes that response back to the client. The other options are all examples of asynchronous invocations.
---
Question #: 378
How can you analyze and query your detailed AWS Cost and Usage Report (CUR) data using standard SQL?

A. By importing the report into a relational database like RDS.
B. By using the filtering capabilities in the AWS Bills page.
C. By setting up the CUR to integrate with Amazon Athena.
D. By using CloudTrail to query the data.

Answer: C

Explanation: A powerful feature of the CUR is its integration with Amazon Athena. When you set up the CUR, you can choose to have it automatically configured for querying with Athena. This allows you to run complex SQL queries directly on the detailed billing files stored in S3, enabling deep cost analysis without needing to manage a database.
---
Question #: 379
A Lambda function, written in Node.js, uses an external library that is 100 MB in size. The function's own code is only 10 KB. What is the most efficient way to deploy this function?

A. Package the function code and the 100 MB library together in a single .zip file.
B. Create a Lambda Layer containing the 100 MB library, and then deploy the 10 KB function package separately, referencing the layer.
C. Store the library in S3 and download it into `/tmp` during the function's cold start.
D. Host the library on an EC2 instance and have the Lambda function access it over the network.

Answer: B

Explanation: Lambda Layers are designed to solve this problem. By separating the large, slow-changing dependencies (the library) into a layer, you keep your function's deployment package very small. This speeds up deployments and can improve cold start times, as the Lambda service can cache the layer's contents.
---
Question #: 380
A company is concerned about the cost of data transfer. Which of the following data transfer scenarios is typically free of charge?

A. Data transfer out from EC2 to the internet.
B. Data transfer between two EC2 instances in different AWS Regions.
C. Data transfer between an EC2 instance and an S3 bucket in the same AWS Region.
D. Data transfer between two EC2 instances in different Availability Zones in the same region.

Answer: C

Explanation: AWS generally does not charge for data transfer between services within the same region. This includes traffic between EC2, RDS, S3, DynamoDB, etc., as long as they are all in the same region. Data transfer out to the internet (A), across regions (B), or even across AZs (D) typically incurs a cost.
---
Question #: 381
What is the primary purpose of the AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM)?

A. It is a monitoring tool for serverless applications.
B. It is a framework and specification that simplifies the process of defining, building, and deploying serverless applications on AWS.
C. It is a programming language specifically for AWS Lambda.
D. It is a service for orchestrating Lambda functions.

Answer: B

Explanation: SAM is an open-source framework (an extension of CloudFormation) that provides a shorthand syntax for defining your serverless resources (functions, APIs, tables). The SAM CLI tool helps you build, test locally, package, and deploy your serverless application, streamlining the entire development lifecycle.
---
Question #: 382
A team is using AWS Budgets to monitor their costs. They want to be alerted when their usage of a specific service is on track to exceed the budgeted amount for the month. What type of alert should they configure?

A. An actual cost alert.
B. A forecasted cost alert.
C. A usage limit alert.
D. A daily cost alert.

Answer: B

Explanation: A forecasted cost alert is proactive. It uses your historical spending patterns to project what your total spend will be at the end of the month. By setting an alert on the forecast, you can be notified early in the month that you are on a trajectory to overspend, giving you time to take action before the actual costs are incurred.
---
Question #: 383
Which of the following is a key component of the pricing for Amazon API Gateway's HTTP APIs?

A. A fixed monthly fee plus a per-request charge.
B. Billed for the number of requests and the duration of the backend integration.
C. A per-request charge and a charge for data transfer out.
D. Billed based on the number of routes configured in the API.

Answer: C

Explanation: HTTP APIs, the newer and more cost-effective version of API Gateway, have a simple pricing model. You are charged primarily for the number of API requests you receive. There may also be charges for data transfer out, but the core component is the per-request fee.
---
Question #: 384
What is the maximum amount of memory you can allocate to an AWS Lambda function?

A. 1024 MB (1 GB)
B. 3008 MB (approx. 3 GB)
C. 5120 MB (5 GB)
D. 10240 MB (10 GB)

Answer: D

Explanation: The maximum amount of memory (RAM) that you can configure for a single Lambda function is 10,240 MB, or 10 GB. This also provides the function with a proportional amount of vCPU power.
---
Question #: 385
A company wants to get a summary of their AWS costs for the previous month, broken down by service, sent to their finance team's email inbox on the first of every month. What is the easiest way to automate this?

A. Create a saved report in AWS Cost Explorer and subscribe to it.
B. Manually download the PDF bill from the Bills page and email it.
C. Write a Lambda function to generate and send the report.
D. This is not a feature provided by AWS.

Answer: A

Explanation: AWS Cost Explorer allows you to create and save custom reports. You can create a report that shows the previous month's costs grouped by service. Then, using the subscription feature, you can configure Cost Explorer to automatically email this report to a list of recipients on a daily, weekly, or monthly schedule.
---
Question #: 386
In a serverless, event-driven architecture, what is the role of an event bus like Amazon EventBridge?

A. To store events for long-term archival.
B. To act as a central hub that receives events from various sources and routes them to different targets based on rules.
C. To execute business logic in response to events.
D. To provide a public API endpoint for events.

Answer: B

Explanation: An event bus is a central component that decouples event producers from event consumers. Producers send events to the bus without knowing who will receive them. Consumers create "rules" on the bus that filter for events they are interested in. The bus is then responsible for routing the matching events to the appropriate targets (like Lambda, SQS, etc.), creating a highly scalable and flexible architecture.
---
Question #: 387
A Lambda function, triggered by SQS, is processing a batch of 10 messages. The function code successfully processes all 10 messages. What must the Lambda service do to prevent the messages from being processed again?

A. Nothing, the messages are automatically removed after processing.
B. If the function invocation completes successfully, the Lambda service will automatically delete the batch of messages from the SQS queue.
C. The function's code must explicitly call the `sqs:DeleteMessage` API for each message.
D. The messages will become invisible for the duration of the retention period.

Answer: B

Explanation: This is a key part of the managed integration between Lambda and SQS. The Lambda service handles the message lifecycle for you. It polls the messages, invokes your function, and if your function handler returns successfully (without throwing an error), the service will automatically call the `DeleteMessageBatch` API on your behalf to remove the successfully processed messages from the queue.
---
Question #: 388
A company wants to ensure that no IAM user in their account can launch EC2 instances outside of their home region of `us-east-1`, in order to control costs and data sovereignty. What is the most effective way to enforce this policy for the entire account?

A. Send a company-wide email with the policy.
B. Create an IAM policy that denies `ec2:RunInstances` if the region is not `us-east-1` and attach it to every user and role.
C. Create a Service Control Policy (SCP) in AWS Organizations that denies EC2 actions in all other regions.
D. Set up an AWS Budget for each region and alert when costs are incurred.

Answer: C

Explanation: A Service Control Policy (SCP) is the only way to create a preventative, account-wide guardrail that cannot be overridden by IAM users, or even the root user, within that account. By attaching an SCP to the account (or its OU) that denies actions in other regions, you can effectively enforce this policy from a central management account.
---
Question #: 389
What is a key difference between AWS Lambda and AWS Fargate from a cost perspective?

A. Lambda is billed per second, while Fargate is billed per hour.
B. Fargate is always cheaper than Lambda.
C. Lambda has a free tier for requests and duration, while Fargate's free tier is based on instance hours.
D. Lambda billing is based on requests and GB-seconds, while Fargate billing is based on vCPU-hours and GB-hours for the container task.

Answer: D

Explanation: While both are serverless compute, their pricing dimensions are different. Lambda's pricing model is very fine-grained, based on each individual invocation. Fargate's pricing model is based on the resources (vCPU and memory) you allocate to your container "task" and the duration for which that task runs.
---
Question #: 390
You are looking at your AWS Cost and Usage Report and see a line item for `EC2-Other`. What does this typically represent?

A. The cost of your On-Demand EC2 instances.
B. The cost of data transfer associated with your EC2 instances.
C. The cost of EBS volumes and snapshots attached to your EC2 instances.
D. The cost of Spot Instances.

Answer: C

Explanation: In the detailed billing reports, costs are broken down by usage type. The main charge for EC2 is for the instance running hours (`BoxUsage`). The associated costs for the persistent storage, such as the EBS volumes and any snapshots you create, are often grouped into a category like `EC2-Other` or listed with specific EBS usage types.
---
Question #: 391
An organization has an application composed of many microservices built with Lambda. They want to trace a single user request as it flows through the various Lambda functions and other AWS services to debug performance issues. Which AWS service is designed for this?

A. AWS CloudTrail
B. Amazon CloudWatch Logs
C. AWS X-Ray
D. AWS Cost Explorer

Answer: C

Explanation: AWS X-Ray is a distributed tracing service. It helps developers analyze and debug production, distributed applications, such as those built using a microservices architecture. It provides an end-to-end view of a request as it travels through your application, showing a map of the services involved and identifying performance bottlenecks.
---
Question #: 392
A company wants to get a discount on their predictable, baseline DynamoDB usage. Which pricing model should they use?

A. On-Demand Capacity
B. Reserved Capacity
C. Spot Capacity
D. A DynamoDB Savings Plan

Answer: B

Explanation: For predictable DynamoDB workloads, you can purchase Reserved Capacity. You pay a one-time, upfront fee for a 1-year or 3-year term to reserve a certain amount of read and write capacity. In return, you get a significant discount on the hourly provisioned throughput cost compared to the standard provisioned capacity pricing.
---
Question #: 393
A Lambda function needs to be triggered by changes to a DynamoDB table. What is the event source for the function?

A. An SQS queue
B. An SNS topic
C. A DynamoDB Stream
D. An API Gateway endpoint

Answer: C

Explanation: DynamoDB Streams is the change data capture mechanism for DynamoDB. When you enable a stream on a table, all item-level modifications are written to the stream. You can then configure a Lambda function to be triggered by this stream, allowing you to process data changes in near real-time.

Question #: 394
A company uses a specific set of tags to allocate costs. They want to ensure that all new EC2 instances are created with these tags. How can this be enforced?

A. By using a Service Control Policy (SCP) to deny the `RunInstances` action if the required tags are not present in the request.
B. By manually tagging the instances after they are launched.
C. By creating an AWS Budget to monitor for untagged resources.
D. By using AWS Trusted Advisor.

Answer: A

Explanation: An SCP is a powerful preventative control. You can write a policy that uses a condition to check for the existence of specific tags during a resource creation API call. If the required tags are missing, the SCP can deny the `ec2:RunInstances` action, effectively enforcing your tagging policy at the time of creation.

Question #: 395
What is the primary cost associated with Amazon SNS?

A. A fixed monthly fee per topic.
B. The amount of data stored in the topic.
C. The number of messages published and the number of deliveries made.
D. The number of subscribers to a topic.

Answer: C

Explanation: SNS has a pay-per-use model. You are charged a small fee for every million messages you publish to your topics. You are then also charged for the deliveries that SNS makes, with different prices for different delivery types (e.g., per million deliveries to Lambda, SQS, or HTTPS; per 100 SMS messages; per 1,000 emails).

Question #: 396
A team is developing a new serverless application and wants to deploy it easily from their command line. They want a simple way to define their Lambda functions, API Gateway endpoints, and DynamoDB tables in a single file. Which AWS tool is designed for this?

A. The AWS Management Console
B. The AWS SDK
C. The AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM) CLI
D. The AWS Cost and Usage Report

Answer: C

Explanation: AWS SAM provides a simplified, higher-level syntax (on top of CloudFormation) for defining serverless resources. The SAM CLI is a command-line tool that allows you to build, test locally, package, and deploy your application defined in the SAM template, greatly streamlining the serverless development workflow.

Question #: 397
A company is reviewing its AWS bill and sees a large charge for "NAT Gateway - Data Processing". What does this charge represent?

A. The hourly charge for keeping the NAT Gateway running.
B. The cost of data transferred from the NAT Gateway to the internet.
C. The cost for each gigabyte of data that is processed by the NAT Gateway as it passes through.
D. The cost of creating the NAT Gateway.

Answer: C

Explanation: NAT Gateway pricing has two components: an hourly charge for each gateway, and a data processing charge. The data processing charge is applied to every gigabyte of data that flows through the gateway, regardless of its source or destination. This is often the largest cost component for a heavily used NAT Gateway.
---
Question #: 398
A key principle of cost optimization in a serverless architecture is to "pay for value." What does this mean?

A. You only pay for services that have a high business value.
B. You pay a single, fixed price for all serverless services.
C. Your costs automatically scale up and down with your usage, so you don't pay for idle resources.
D. You must purchase a 1-year plan to get the best value.

Answer: C

Explanation: The "pay for value" or "pay-per-use" model means that your bill is directly tied to the value your application is providing. When there are no users and no requests, you pay nothing (or very little). When there are many users making many requests, your costs scale up, but so does the business activity. This eliminates the cost of over-provisioning and paying for idle capacity.

Question #: 399
A company has a security requirement that all data stored in Amazon S3 must be encrypted at rest. They want to use server-side encryption but want to manage their own encryption keys. However, they do not want to manage the encryption key infrastructure. Which S3 encryption option should they use?

A. Server-Side Encryption with S3-Managed Keys (SSE-S3)
B. Server-Side Encryption with AWS KMS-Managed Keys (SSE-KMS)
C. Server-Side Encryption with Customer-Provided Keys (SSE-C)
D. Client-Side Encryption with a client-side master key.

Answer: B

Explanation: SSE-KMS is the correct choice because it allows the customer to manage their keys (e.g., control rotation, set access policies) through the AWS Key Management Service (KMS), while AWS manages the underlying hardware and software for the key management infrastructure. SSE-S3 (A) has AWS manage the keys entirely. SSE-C (C) requires the customer to provide the key with every request. Client-side encryption (D) requires the customer to manage the entire encryption process and infrastructure.
---
Question #: 400
What is the primary function of the AWS Key Management Service (KMS)?

A. To create and manage SSL/TLS certificates for websites.
B. To create and control the encryption keys used to encrypt your data.
C. To securely store secrets and application configuration data.
D. To encrypt network traffic between AWS services.

Answer: B

Explanation: AWS KMS is a managed service that makes it easy for you to create and control the cryptographic keys used to protect your data. It is integrated with many other AWS services to simplify the encryption of data at rest. AWS Certificate Manager (A) handles SSL/TLS certificates. AWS Secrets Manager (C) stores secrets. SSL/TLS (D) encrypts data in transit.
---
Question #: 401
An application writes data to an S3 bucket that has default encryption enabled using SSE-KMS. What happens when an object is uploaded to this bucket without any encryption headers in the request?

A. The upload is rejected because encryption headers are missing.
B. The object is stored unencrypted.
C. Amazon S3 automatically encrypts the object using the default KMS key specified for the bucket.
D. The object is encrypted using SSE-S3 instead of SSE-KMS.

Answer: C

Explanation: S3 default encryption is designed to enforce an encryption policy. If default encryption is enabled on a bucket, any new object uploaded without encryption information in the request will be automatically encrypted using the specified default method (in this case, SSE-KMS with the bucket's default KMS key).
---
Question #: 402
What is the difference between the master key (CMK/KMS key) and the data key in the KMS envelope encryption process?

A. The master key is used to encrypt data directly, while the data key is used to encrypt the master key.
B. The master key is used to generate and encrypt data keys, and the data keys are then used to encrypt the actual data.
C. Both keys are used together in an XOR operation to encrypt the data.
D. The master key is stored in AWS, while the data key must be stored on-premises.

Answer: B

Explanation: Envelope encryption is a core concept in KMS. You use a KMS key (master key) to generate a unique data key. You then use this data key to encrypt your data locally. The plaintext data key is then discarded, and the encrypted version of the data key is stored alongside your encrypted data. This is efficient and secure because the highly protected master key never leaves KMS and is only used to encrypt/decrypt small data keys.
---
Question #: 403
A company needs to encrypt an Amazon EBS volume attached to an EC2 instance. They want to use an encryption key that they create and control in AWS. Which service should they use?

A. AWS Secrets Manager
B. AWS Certificate Manager
C. AWS CloudHSM
D. AWS Key Management Service (KMS)

Answer: D

Explanation: Amazon EBS is natively integrated with AWS KMS. When you create an encrypted EBS volume, you can specify a KMS key. EBS then uses this key in an envelope encryption process to protect the volume's data. CloudHSM (C) is also an option for key storage, but KMS is the more common and integrated service for this use case.
---
Question #: 404
How is data in transit to and from Amazon S3 typically secured?

A. By using AWS PrivateLink.
B. By using IPsec VPN tunnels.
C. By using Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS).
D. By encrypting the data with a KMS key before sending it.

Answer: C

Explanation: Communication with Amazon S3 endpoints occurs over HTTPS, which uses SSL/TLS to encrypt the data in transit between your client and the S3 service. This is the standard mechanism for protecting data on the wire. While you can pre-encrypt data (D), SSL/TLS is the default in-transit protection provided by the service itself.
---
Question #: 405
A security policy requires that the encryption keys used for an Amazon RDS database are stored in a dedicated, single-tenant hardware security module (HSM) under the company's exclusive control. Which KMS key store option meets this requirement?

A. A standard KMS key store.
B. An AWS CloudHSM key store.
C. A KMS key with imported key material.
D. An external key store (XKS).

Answer: B

Explanation: For customers who require keys to be stored in a single-tenant HSM, KMS provides the option to create a custom key store backed by an AWS CloudHSM cluster. This combines the integration and ease of use of KMS with the dedicated, customer-controlled HSM environment of CloudHSM.
---
Question #: 406
When you use SSE-C (Server-Side Encryption with Customer-Provided Keys) for an S3 object, what is AWS responsible for?

A. Managing the encryption key and the encryption process.
B. Managing the encryption key, but the customer manages the encryption process.
C. Managing the encryption and decryption process, but not the key itself.
D. Neither the key nor the encryption process.

Answer: C

Explanation: With SSE-C, you provide the encryption key along with your PUT request. S3 uses that key to encrypt the object using AES-256 and then discards the key. When you want to retrieve the object, you must provide the exact same key in your GET request. AWS handles the encryption/decryption compute but does not store or manage your key.
---
Question #: 407
Which of the following statements about encrypting an Amazon RDS database instance is TRUE?

A. You can only enable encryption when you first create the RDS instance.
B. Encryption can be enabled or disabled at any time on a running RDS instance.
C. To encrypt an existing unencrypted RDS instance, you must create a snapshot, copy the snapshot while enabling encryption, and then restore a new instance from the encrypted snapshot.
D. RDS encryption only encrypts the data at rest, not the automated backups.

Answer: C

Explanation: You cannot directly enable encryption on an existing, unencrypted RDS instance. The standard procedure is to take a snapshot of the unencrypted instance, create an encrypted copy of that snapshot, and then restore a new, encrypted RDS instance from the encrypted snapshot. This process also encrypts all future automated backups and read replicas.
---
Question #: 408
What is the purpose of a Key Policy in AWS KMS?

A. To define the cryptographic algorithm used by the KMS key.
B. To control access to the KMS key, defining who can use it and for what actions.
C. To set an automatic rotation schedule for the key material.
D. To specify which AWS regions the key can be replicated to.

Answer: B

Explanation: The key policy is the primary access control mechanism for a KMS key. It is a resource-based policy that you attach to the key itself. It defines which IAM users and roles (principals) are allowed to perform which KMS actions (e.g., `kms:Encrypt`, `kms:Decrypt`, `kms:GenerateDataKey`) on that specific key.
---
Question #: 409
An organization wants to ensure that all new EBS volumes created in their account are encrypted by default. What should they do?

A. Create an IAM policy that denies the `ec2:CreateVolume` action if encryption is not specified.
B. Manually encrypt each volume after it is created.
C. Enable the "EBS encryption by default" setting for the AWS region.
D. This is not possible; encryption must be specified for each volume individually.

Answer: C

Explanation: AWS provides an account-level setting on a per-region basis called "EBS encryption by default". When this feature is enabled, any new EBS volume created in that region will be automatically encrypted using the default KMS key for EBS, even if encryption is not specified in the creation request.
---
Question #: 410
How does S3 Bucket Key feature improve the performance and cost of using SSE-KMS?

A. It encrypts the entire bucket with a single data key.
B. It uses a more efficient encryption algorithm than AES-256.
C. It reduces the number of requests made to KMS by generating a short-lived bucket-level key that is used to create data keys for individual objects.
D. It caches KMS keys within the S3 service to reduce latency.

Answer: C

Explanation: With standard SSE-KMS, S3 must make a request to KMS for every single object to get a unique data key. The S3 Bucket Key feature reduces this traffic. S3 requests a temporary bucket-level key from KMS, and then uses that key within S3 to create the unique data keys for new objects. This significantly reduces the request load on KMS, lowering costs and improving performance.
---
Question #: 411
Which of the following are encrypted when you enable encryption for an Amazon RDS database? (Choose TWO)

A. The data at rest on the underlying storage volume.
B. Data in transit between the application and the database.
C. Automated backups of the database.
D. SQL queries sent to the database.
E. The database instance's metadata.

Answer: A, C

Explanation: RDS encryption protects data at rest. This includes the underlying EBS volume where the data is stored (A), as well as all automated backups, read replicas, and snapshots (C). Encryption for data in transit (B, D) is handled separately by configuring SSL/TLS for the database connection.
---
Question #: 412
A developer needs to encrypt a small amount of configuration data (less than 4KB) directly using AWS KMS without performing client-side encryption. Which KMS API call should be used?

A. `GenerateDataKey`
B. `Encrypt`
C. `Decrypt`
D. `CreateKey`

Answer: B

Explanation: The `Encrypt` API call is designed for directly encrypting small amounts of data (up to 4 KB) using a KMS key. For larger amounts of data, the best practice is to use envelope encryption with the `GenerateDataKey` API call. `CreateKey` (D) is for creating a new KMS key.
---
Question #: 413
A company is using client-side encryption to protect data before uploading it to S3. They are using the AWS Encryption SDK. Where is the data encrypted?

A. On the Amazon S3 service, just before being written to disk.
B. Within the AWS KMS service.
C. On the client application (e.g., an EC2 instance or an on-premises server) before the data is sent to S3.
D. By a Lambda function that triggers on every S3 upload.

Answer: C

Explanation: The term "client-side encryption" means the encryption process happens on the client's end. The application uses a library like the AWS Encryption SDK to encrypt the data locally. The encrypted data (ciphertext) is then uploaded to S3. S3 stores the data as-is, unaware that it is encrypted.
---
Question #: 414
What is the primary benefit of enabling automatic key rotation in AWS KMS?

A. It increases the cryptographic strength of the key.
B. It reduces the risk associated with a compromised key by limiting the amount of data encrypted under any single version of the key.
C. It allows the key to be used in multiple AWS regions.
D. It changes the key's ARN and alias.

Answer: B

Explanation: The primary security benefit of key rotation is to limit the "blast radius" if a key were ever compromised. By automatically creating a new version of the key material each year, you limit the amount of data protected by any single version. This is a cryptographic best practice that reduces risk. It does not change the key's metadata like its ARN or alias (D), which allows for transparent use in applications.
---
Question #: 415
To enforce the use of SSL/TLS for connections to an Amazon RDS for MySQL database, what should you do?

A. Enable RDS encryption at rest.
B. Configure the database instance's security group to only allow traffic on port 3306.
C. Require the `ssl` option in the database connection parameters for all users.
D. Install a certificate from AWS Certificate Manager on the RDS instance.

Answer: C

Explanation: RDS encryption at rest (A) is separate from encryption in transit. To enforce encrypted connections, you must configure the database itself. For MySQL, this typically involves setting the `require_secure_transport` parameter on the DB parameter group and ensuring users are created with the `REQUIRE SSL` option, which forces clients to connect using TLS/SSL.
---
Question #: 416
You are using SSE-KMS to encrypt an S3 bucket. A user with `s3:GetObject` permission for the bucket is unable to download an encrypted object. What is the most likely missing permission?

A. `s3:Decrypt`
B. `kms:GenerateDataKey`
C. `kms:Decrypt`
D. `iam:PassRole`

Answer: C

Explanation: To download an object encrypted with SSE-KMS, a user needs two permissions: `s3:GetObject` for the object itself, and `kms:Decrypt` for the specific KMS key that was used to encrypt the object's data key. Without the `kms:Decrypt` permission, the user can fetch the encrypted object from S3 but cannot ask KMS to decrypt its data key, making the object's content inaccessible.
---
Question #: 417
Which AWS service is used to create and manage public and private SSL/TLS certificates for use with AWS services like Elastic Load Balancer and CloudFront?

A. AWS Key Management Service (KMS)
B. AWS Secrets Manager
C. AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)
D. AWS CloudHSM

Answer: C

Explanation: AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) is the service specifically designed for provisioning, managing, and deploying public and private SSL/TLS certificates. It integrates seamlessly with services like ELB and CloudFront to simplify the process of enabling HTTPS for your applications.
---
Question #: 418
What is a key difference between a symmetric and an asymmetric KMS key?

A. Symmetric keys can be used for both encryption and decryption, while asymmetric keys have separate public and private keys for these operations.
B. Symmetric keys are managed by AWS, while asymmetric keys must be managed by the customer.
C. Symmetric keys support automatic rotation, while asymmetric keys do not.
D. Symmetric keys can only be used in a single region.

Answer: A

Explanation: This is the fundamental difference. A symmetric key uses the same key for both encrypting and decrypting data. An asymmetric key pair consists of a public key (which you can share and is used for encryption) and a private key (which is kept secret in KMS and is used for decryption). KMS supports both types.
---
Question #: 419
A company wants to store their encryption keys in a system where they can directly verify the FIPS 140-2 Level 3 compliance of the hardware. Which AWS service provides this?

A. AWS Key Management Service (KMS)
B. AWS Secrets Manager
C. AWS Shield
D. AWS CloudHSM

Answer: D

Explanation: AWS CloudHSM provides hardware security modules (HSMs) in the AWS Cloud. The HSMs are FIPS 140-2 Level 3 validated. This service allows you to have a dedicated, single-tenant HSM environment where you have much more direct control over the hardware and key management compared to the multi-tenant KMS service.
---
Question #: 420
When you enable encryption on a new EBS volume, what is the performance impact?

A. A significant increase in I/O latency.
B. A significant decrease in volume throughput.
C. A minimal impact on I/O latency and throughput.
D. It varies depending on the EC2 instance type.

Answer: C

Explanation: Amazon EBS encryption is implemented using the hardware acceleration capabilities of modern EC2 instances (AES-NI). As a result, there is a minimal effect on the I/O latency and throughput of the volume. For most workloads, the performance impact is negligible.
---
Question #: 421
To protect data in transit for a web application running on EC2 instances behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB), where should the SSL/TLS certificate be installed?

A. On each of the individual EC2 instances.
B. On the Application Load Balancer.
C. Within the AWS KMS service.
D. In the Route 53 hosted zone for the domain.

Answer: B

Explanation: The standard and recommended architecture is to perform SSL/TLS termination at the load balancer. You install the SSL certificate on the ALB. The ALB then handles the decryption of incoming HTTPS traffic from clients and can forward the traffic to the backend EC2 instances over HTTP within your secure VPC.
---
Question #: 422
What is the purpose of an "Alias" in AWS KMS?

A. It is the unique Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the key.
B. It is a friendly name or display name that can be used to refer to a KMS key.
C. It is the policy document that controls access to the key.
D. It is a tag used for cost allocation.

Answer: B

Explanation: An alias is a user-friendly name that you can associate with a KMS key. Instead of referring to a key by its long, complex key ID or ARN, you can use the alias (e.g., `alias/my-app-key`) in your application code and IAM policies. This also makes key rotation easier, as you can just update the alias to point to a new key without changing your code.
---
Question #: 423
You are using client-side encryption with a KMS-managed master key. Your application is running on an EC2 instance. What is the correct sequence of API calls?

A. Call `kms:Encrypt` with the data, then upload to S3.
B. Call `kms:GenerateDataKey`, use the plaintext key to encrypt data locally, upload the encrypted data and the encrypted data key to S3.
C. Upload plaintext data to S3, then call `kms:Encrypt` on the S3 object.
D. Call `kms:Decrypt` to get a data key, encrypt the data, then upload to S3.

Answer: B

Explanation: This sequence describes the envelope encryption process. The application first calls `kms:GenerateDataKey` which returns both a plaintext and an encrypted version of a new data key. The application uses the plaintext key to encrypt the large data object. It then uploads the resulting ciphertext and the *encrypted* data key to S3 for storage. The plaintext key is discarded.
---
Question #: 424
You need to provide an auditor with evidence that your KMS keys are being used as expected and only by authorized principals. Which AWS service would you use to get this information?

A. AWS Trusted Advisor
B. AWS Config
C. AWS CloudTrail
D. Amazon Inspector

Answer: C

Explanation: All calls made to the AWS KMS API are recorded as events in AWS CloudTrail. By analyzing your CloudTrail logs, you can see who used which key, from what IP address, on which resource, and at what time. This provides a detailed audit trail of all key usage.
---
Question #: 425
What is the default encryption method for a new Amazon S3 bucket?

A. No encryption is enabled by default.
B. SSE-S3 is enabled by default.
C. SSE-KMS is enabled by default.
D. Client-side encryption is enabled by default.

Answer: B

Explanation: As of January 2023, Amazon S3 now automatically enables Server-Side Encryption with S3-Managed Keys (SSE-S3) as the base level of encryption for all new objects added to any bucket. This is the new default setting for all new buckets.
---
Question #: 426
Which of the following encryption keys can you, as a customer, directly access the key material for?

A. An AWS managed KMS key (e.g., `aws/s3`).
B. A customer managed KMS key.
C. Key material imported into a KMS key.
D. The private key of an asymmetric key pair in KMS.

Answer: C

Explanation: In general, you can never export or view the plaintext key material of a KMS key. The exception is when you use the "imported key material" feature. In this case, you generate the key material yourself outside of AWS and then securely import it into a KMS key. You possess the original key material, but once imported, it cannot be exported from KMS.
---
Question #: 427
A company wants to encrypt objects in S3 but needs to use a different encryption key for each object. Which encryption method is most suitable for this?

A. SSE-S3
B. SSE-KMS
C. SSE-C
D. S3 default bucket encryption.

Answer: B

Explanation: Both SSE-KMS and client-side encryption use envelope encryption, which means every object gets its own unique data key. This data key is then encrypted by a master key. This provides object-level key separation. SSE-S3 also uses a similar mechanism, but with SSE-KMS (B), you have more control and visibility over the master keys used in this process.
---
Question #: 428
How can you enforce that all objects uploaded to an S3 bucket are encrypted using SSE-KMS?

A. By using an S3 Access Point policy.
B. By using a bucket policy that denies `s3:PutObject` requests if the `x-amz-server-side-encryption` header is not set to `aws:kms`.
C. By enabling S3 default encryption on the bucket.
D. Both B and C are valid methods.

Answer: D

Explanation: You can enforce this in two primary ways. You can set the default encryption on the bucket to SSE-KMS (C), which automatically encrypts all new objects. For a more explicit, preventative control, you can also add a bucket policy (B) that explicitly denies any upload request that does not include the correct encryption header. Using both provides defense in depth.
---
Question #: 429
What does "encryption at rest" refer to?

A. Encrypting data as it travels over a network.
B. Encrypting data that is stored on a physical medium like a disk or SSD.
C. Encrypting data that is currently being processed in an EC2 instance's memory.
D. Encrypting the AWS Management Console password.

Answer: B

Explanation: "Encryption at rest" is a security term for the protection of data when it is not in transit and is stored on a persistent storage device. This includes data on EBS volumes, in S3 buckets, in RDS databases, etc.
---
Question #: 430
You are using an Application Load Balancer with an HTTPS listener. You want to encrypt the traffic between the load balancer and the backend EC2 instances. What is this practice called?

A. SSL Termination
B. End-to-end Encryption
C. SSL Offloading
D. In-transit Encryption

Answer: B

Explanation: This configuration is known as end-to-end encryption. The first leg of encryption is from the client to the load balancer (SSL termination). The second leg of encryption is from the load balancer to the backend instances. When both legs are encrypted, it provides end-to-end protection for the data.
---
Question #: 431
A KMS key policy contains the following statement. What is its effect?
`{ "Sid": "Allow use of the key", "Effect": "Allow", "Principal": {"AWS": "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:root"}, "Action": "kms:*", "Resource": "*" }`

A. It allows any IAM user in account 111122223333 to perform any action on the key.
B. It gives full control over the key to the root user of account 111122223333, and allows the account to delegate permissions to its IAM users and roles.
C. It only allows the root user to use the key and no other IAM users.
D. It allows any AWS account to use the key.

Answer: B

Explanation: Granting permissions to the account root principal (`"arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT_ID:root"`) in a key policy is the standard way to enable centralized control. It makes the account's root user the key administrator and, importantly, allows IAM policies within that account to be used to grant permissions for the key. Without this, only the key policy could be used to grant permissions.
---
Question #: 432
Which type of KMS key is managed and used exclusively by an AWS service on your behalf?

A. Customer Managed Key
B. AWS Managed Key
C. AWS Owned Key
D. Imported Key

Answer: B

Explanation: AWS Managed Keys are KMS keys in your account that are created, managed, and used on your behalf by an integrated AWS service (e.g., `aws/rds`, `aws/s3`). You can view their policies and audit their use in CloudTrail, but you cannot delete them or change their key policies. AWS Owned Keys (C) are a separate category managed entirely by AWS and not visible in your account.
---
Question #: 433
An EBS snapshot is taken from an unencrypted EBS volume. By default, is the snapshot encrypted?

A. Yes, all snapshots are encrypted by default.
B. No, a snapshot of an unencrypted volume is unencrypted by default.
C. It depends on the account's "EBS encryption by default" setting.
D. Yes, it is encrypted using a default AWS managed key.

Answer: B

Explanation: The encryption state of an EBS snapshot is determined by the encryption state of the volume it was created from. A snapshot of an unencrypted volume will be unencrypted. A snapshot of an encrypted volume will be encrypted with the same key. You can, however, create an encrypted copy of an unencrypted snapshot.
---
Question #: 434
What is the primary benefit of using a VPC Endpoint for an AWS service like KMS?

A. It reduces the cost of making KMS API calls.
B. It allows you to use KMS from an on-premises data center.
C. It keeps all traffic between your VPC and the KMS service on the private AWS network, enhancing security.
D. It enables automatic rotation of KMS keys.

Answer: C

Explanation: A VPC Endpoint (specifically, an Interface Endpoint for KMS) provides a private and secure connection to the KMS API. It creates a network interface with a private IP in your VPC, and all API calls are routed through it, avoiding the public internet. This improves security and can provide more reliable network performance.
---
Question #: 435
You need to share an encrypted EBS snapshot with another AWS account. The snapshot was encrypted with a customer-managed KMS key. What must you do to allow the other account to use the snapshot?

A. Simply share the snapshot; the permissions are inherited.
B. Create an IAM role in your account that the other account can assume.
C. Modify the KMS key's policy to allow the other account's root principal to use the key.
D. You cannot share EBS snapshots that are encrypted with a customer-managed key.

Answer: C

Explanation: To share an encrypted resource, you must share two things: the resource itself (the snapshot) and the key that encrypted it. You modify the KMS key policy to add a statement that allows the target AWS account to perform necessary actions (like `kms:DescribeKey`, `kms:ReEncrypt*`). After sharing both the snapshot and the key, the target account can copy the snapshot, re-encrypting it with their own key in the process.
---
Question #: 436
What is the purpose of an IAM "condition key" like `kms:EncryptionContext` in a policy?

A. To check if the data being encrypted is larger than 4KB.
B. To enforce that a specific key-value pair is included in the encryption context of a KMS API call.
C. To specify the region where the encryption must take place.
D. To require that the user is authenticated with MFA.

Answer: B

Explanation: Encryption context is an optional set of key-value pairs that you can pass with a KMS request. It provides additional authenticated data (AAD). You can use IAM policy conditions to check for the presence or value of these pairs. This is a powerful security control to ensure that a key is only used in the specific context you intend (e.g., for a specific application or resource).
---
Question #: 437
To meet compliance requirements, a company must be able to delete the encryption key material for a specific set of data on demand. Which is the best option in KMS?

A. Use an AWS Managed Key, as AWS will delete it upon request.
B. Use a Customer Managed Key with imported key material, then delete the key material.
C. Use a Customer Managed Key and delete the key.
D. Use SSE-S3 encryption.

Answer: B

Explanation: When you use a KMS key with imported key material, you have the option to manually delete the imported key material from the key at any time. This renders any data encrypted under that key permanently unrecoverable. This is a more direct and immediate action than scheduling a key for deletion (which has a waiting period) and meets the requirement to delete only the key material.

Question #: 438
Which of the following services are integrated with AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) for deploying SSL/TLS certificates? (Choose TWO)

A. Amazon EC2 Instances
B. Amazon CloudFront
C. Amazon Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)
D. Amazon RDS
E. AWS Lambda

Answer: B, C

Explanation: AWS Certificate Manager is designed for easy integration with AWS services that terminate SSL/TLS connections at the edge of the network. The primary integrations are with Amazon CloudFront distributions and Elastic Load Balancers (Application, Network, and Classic). You cannot deploy an ACM certificate directly onto an EC2 instance or an RDS database.

Question #: 439
A key policy grants permissions to a user. The user's IAM policy explicitly denies the same KMS permissions. What is the result when the user tries to use the key?

A. The user can use the key because the key policy allows it.
B. The user cannot use the key because an explicit deny in any policy takes precedence.
C. The user can use the key, but only if they assume a role first.
D. The result depends on which policy was last updated.

Answer: B

Explanation: The IAM evaluation logic is consistent across services. If an explicit `Deny` exists in any applicable policy (identity-based, resource-based like a key policy, etc.), it will always override any `Allow` statements. Therefore, the deny in the IAM policy will prevent the user from accessing the key.
---
Question #: 440
What is the waiting period when you schedule a customer-managed KMS key for deletion, and can it be changed?

A. 24 hours, and it cannot be changed.
B. 30 days, and it can be reduced to a minimum of 7 days.
C. 7 to 30 days, configurable by the user.
D. There is no waiting period; deletion is immediate.

Answer: C

Explanation: To prevent accidental or malicious deletion of critical keys, KMS enforces a mandatory waiting period when you schedule a key for deletion. You can configure this period to be anywhere from a minimum of 7 days to a maximum of 30 days. The default is 30 days. During this period, you can cancel the deletion.
---
Question #: 441
You are encrypting data using the AWS Encryption SDK and envelope encryption. What is stored alongside the encrypted data (the ciphertext)?

A. The plaintext data key.
B. The KMS master key's ARN.
C. The encrypted data key and other metadata.
D. A copy of the KMS master key material.

Answer: C

Explanation: The output of the encryption process (the "ciphertext message") produced by the SDK includes the encrypted data itself, a copy of the encrypted data key(s), the algorithm identifier, and the encryption context. This allows the SDK's decrypt function to have all the information it needs to request the decryption of the data key from KMS.
---
Question #: 442
You need to encrypt the connection between your application and an RDS for PostgreSQL database. What should you do?

A. Download the AWS root CA certificate and reference it in your application's connection string.
B. Enable KMS encryption on the RDS instance.
C. Configure the database security group to allow only encrypted traffic.
D. Nothing, all RDS connections are encrypted by default.

Answer: A

Explanation: To establish a secure, encrypted connection to an RDS instance using SSL/TLS, the client application needs to trust the certificate authority that issued the server's certificate. AWS provides a root CA certificate that you can download. Your application's database driver should be configured to use this certificate to validate the server's identity and establish an encrypted channel.
---
Question #: 443
What happens when a KMS key that was used to encrypt data is disabled?

A. The key and all data encrypted with it are immediately deleted.
B. You can no longer use the key for new encryption operations, but you can still decrypt existing data.
C. You can no longer use the key for either encryption or decryption until it is re-enabled.
D. The key is automatically scheduled for deletion.

Answer: C

Explanation: Disabling a KMS key has an immediate effect. It prevents the key from being used in any cryptographic operation. Any attempt to encrypt new data or decrypt existing data protected by that key will fail until the key is re-enabled. This is a useful temporary control to deny access to data.
---
Question #: 444
Which S3 server-side encryption method gives you the most direct control over key rotation policies and provides a detailed audit trail of key usage in CloudTrail?

A. Server-Side Encryption with S3-Managed Keys (SSE-S3)
B. Server-Side Encryption with AWS KMS-Managed Keys (SSE-KMS)
C. Server-Side Encryption with Customer-Provided Keys (SSE-C)
D. All of the above provide the same level of control.

Answer: B

Explanation: When you use SSE-KMS, the encryption operations involve a customer-managed or AWS-managed key in your KMS account. This means you can control the key's policies, enable automatic rotation, and, critically, all API calls to KMS (like `Decrypt` when an object is downloaded) are logged in CloudTrail, giving you a complete audit trail. SSE-S3 and SSE-C operations are not logged in the same way in CloudTrail.
---
Question #: 445
A snapshot of an encrypted EBS volume is created. The original volume was encrypted with KMS key "Key-A". The snapshot is then copied to another region. What must you specify during the copy operation?

A. Nothing, the snapshot is copied and remains encrypted with Key-A.
B. A KMS key in the destination region to be used to re-encrypt the snapshot copy.
C. An IAM role that has permission to access Key-A.
D. The password for Key-A.

Answer: B

Explanation: KMS keys are regional resources. You cannot use a key from one region to encrypt a resource in another. When you copy an encrypted snapshot to a different region, you must specify a KMS key that exists in that destination region. The copy process involves decrypting the data using the source key and immediately re-encrypting it with the destination key.
---
Question #: 446
What is "in-transit encryption"?

A. The encryption of data on removable media like USB drives.
B. The encryption of data as it is being processed by a CPU.
C. The encryption of data as it travels across a network.
D. The encryption of data stored in a database.

Answer: C

Explanation: In-transit encryption, also known as data in motion, refers to the protection of data as it is being transmitted between two systems, such as between a user's browser and a web server, or between an application server and a database. This is typically accomplished using protocols like TLS/SSL or IPsec.
---
Question #: 447
An application running on-premises needs to use AWS KMS to generate data keys for client-side encryption. The on-premises network is connected to a VPC via AWS Direct Connect. How can the application securely call the KMS API?

A. By routing the traffic over the public internet to the regional KMS endpoint.
B. By creating an Interface VPC Endpoint for KMS and accessing it over the Direct Connect connection.
C. By installing a CloudHSM appliance on-premises.
D. This is not possible; KMS can only be called from within AWS.

Answer: B

Explanation: By creating an Interface VPC Endpoint for KMS, you expose the KMS service as a private endpoint within your VPC. Because your on-premises network is connected to the VPC via Direct Connect, your on-premises application can now resolve the KMS endpoint's private DNS name and send API calls securely over the private Direct Connect link.
---
Question #: 448
Which of the following is a characteristic of an AWS Managed KMS Key (e.g., `aws/ebs`)?

A. You can edit its key policy.
B. You can enable or disable its automatic rotation schedule.
C. You can view its key policy but cannot edit it.
D. You can import your own key material into it.

Answer: C

Explanation: AWS Managed Keys are created and managed by AWS services for use in your account. You have limited control over them. You can view their key policy (which is managed by the service) and track their usage in CloudTrail, but you cannot edit the policy, change the rotation schedule, or delete the key.
---
Question #: 449
You are using SSE-C to upload an object to S3. What happens if you lose the encryption key you provided?

A. You can ask AWS support to recover the key for you.
B. You can retrieve the key from AWS KMS.
C. The object is permanently and irretrievably lost.
D. S3 automatically converts the encryption to SSE-S3.

Answer: C

Explanation: With SSE-C, AWS never stores your key. It uses it for the encryption operation and then immediately discards it. The responsibility for managing and protecting the key is entirely yours. If you lose the key, there is no mechanism to decrypt the object, and the data is lost forever.
---
Question #: 450
You want to view all the customer-managed KMS keys in your account and see who last used them. What is the most efficient way to do this?

A. Analyze AWS CloudTrail logs for the past 90 days.
B. Use the AWS IAM Access Advisor.
C. Look at the "Last accessed" information in the AWS KMS console.
D. Use the AWS Config dashboard.

Answer: A

Explanation: While the KMS console might show some usage information, the definitive and detailed record of all API activity is AWS CloudTrail. You would need to filter your CloudTrail logs for KMS API calls (like `Encrypt`, `Decrypt`, `GenerateDataKey`) to build a complete picture of key usage. Tools like Amazon Athena can be used to query these logs efficiently.
---
Question #: 451
Which of the following is a valid use case for an asymmetric KMS key pair?

A. Encrypting an EBS volume.
B. Encrypting an S3 bucket using default encryption.
C. A digital signing application where you sign data with the private key and others verify with the public key.
D. Encrypting an RDS database.

Answer: C

Explanation: Asymmetric key pairs are designed for use cases like digital signing or public key encryption. In a signing scenario, your application would call the KMS `Sign` API, and KMS would use the private key (which never leaves KMS) to create a signature. You can then distribute the public key to anyone who needs to verify the signature. Integrated services like EBS, S3, and RDS use symmetric KMS keys for encryption.
---
Question #: 452
You have an S3 bucket that must store objects that are encrypted with different KMS keys depending on the sensitivity of the data. How can you achieve this?

A. This is not possible; a bucket can only have one KMS key.
B. Create different prefixes (folders) in the bucket and apply different bucket policies to each.
C. In the `s3:PutObject` API call for each object, specify the desired KMS key ARN in the `x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id` header.
D. Use S3 Batch Operations to re-encrypt the objects after they are uploaded.

Answer: C

Explanation: SSE-KMS is applied at the object level. Even if a bucket has a default KMS key, you can override it for any specific upload. By including the `x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id` header in your PUT request, you can specify exactly which KMS key should be used to encrypt that particular object.
---
Question #: 453
What is the purpose of using encryption context in an `Encrypt` call to KMS?

A. It encrypts the context along with the data.
B. It provides additional authenticated data (AAD) that adds a layer of integrity checking.
C. It tells KMS which IAM user is making the call.
D. It specifies the encryption algorithm to be used.

Answer: B

Explanation: Encryption context is not encrypted, but it is cryptographically bound to the ciphertext. When you decrypt, you must pass the exact same encryption context. If the context provided during decryption does not match the one used during encryption, the decryption will fail. This acts as an integrity check and ensures the key is only used in the intended context.
---
Question #: 454
A web application uses an Application Load Balancer. To secure the connection from clients to the ALB, you have provisioned a certificate using AWS Certificate Manager (ACM). What is a major benefit of using an ACM certificate?

A. ACM certificates provide a higher level of encryption than other certificates.
B. ACM can automatically renew the certificate before it expires.
C. ACM certificates can be exported and used on any web server.
D. ACM certificates do not require a domain name.

Answer: B

Explanation: A key feature and benefit of using public certificates from ACM is managed renewal. As long as the certificate is in use with an integrated service (like an ELB or CloudFront) and your domain validation is still in place, ACM will automatically renew the certificate before it expires, without any manual intervention required.
---
Question #: 455
When you create a customer-managed KMS key, what is the default state of automatic key rotation?

A. It is enabled and set to rotate every 90 days.
B. It is enabled and set to rotate every 365 days.
C. It is disabled by default.
D. It must be configured during key creation and cannot be changed.

Answer: C

Explanation: For customer-managed keys (CMKs), automatic key rotation is disabled by default. You must explicitly opt-in to enable it. Once enabled, KMS will rotate the key material once every 365 days.
---
Question #: 456
You need to encrypt a 10 GB file before uploading it to S3. Which KMS operation is the most appropriate for your client-side encryption logic?

A. `kms:Encrypt`
B. `kms:ReEncrypt`
C. `kms:GenerateDataKey`
D. `kms:CreateGrant`

Answer: C

Explanation: The `kms:Encrypt` API can only handle up to 4 KB of data. For large objects, you must use envelope encryption. The correct operation is `kms:GenerateDataKey`, which provides a unique data key to encrypt the 10 GB file locally on your client. The encrypted data key is then stored with the encrypted file.
---
Question #: 457
An S3 bucket policy contains a condition that checks for `s3:x-amz-server-side-encryption`. What is the purpose of this condition?

A. To enforce that all objects are stored in a specific storage class.
B. To enforce that all objects are encrypted at rest using a specific server-side encryption method.
C. To check if the user is accessing the bucket from a specific IP address.
D. To require an MFA token for all uploads.

Answer: B

Explanation: This S3-specific condition key allows you to check the value of the server-side encryption header in a request. You can use it in a bucket policy to deny uploads that do not have the header set to a specific value, such as `AES256` (for SSE-S3) or `aws:kms` (for SSE-KMS), thereby enforcing encryption.
---
Question #: 458
Which of the following are valid ways to secure data in transit when connecting to an EC2 instance? (Choose TWO)

A. Using the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol.
B. Encrypting the EBS volume attached to the instance.
C. Using the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) with network-level authentication.
D. Attaching a security group that allows all traffic.
E. Enabling detailed monitoring for the instance.

Answer: A, C

Explanation: SSH (for Linux) and RDP (for Windows) are protocols used to remotely manage instances. Both protocols establish an encrypted tunnel between the client and the server, protecting the data in transit. EBS encryption (B) protects data at rest. A permissive security group (D) reduces security. Monitoring (E) is for performance, not encryption.
---
Question #: 459
You've been given an encrypted S3 object and an encrypted data key. You also have IAM permissions to use a specific KMS key. Which KMS API call do you need to make to begin the decryption process?

A. `Encrypt`
B. `Decrypt`
C. `GenerateDataKey`
D. `ReEncrypt`

Answer: B

Explanation: The first step in decrypting data that was encrypted using envelope encryption is to decrypt the data key. You would make a `Decrypt` API call to KMS, providing the encrypted data key. If you have the correct permissions, KMS will use the master key to decrypt the data key and return the plaintext version to you. You then use this plaintext key to decrypt the main object.
---
Question #: 460
A company's security policy states that developers should not have access to production encryption keys. However, developers need to use these keys to encrypt data for the production environment. How can this be achieved using KMS?

A. Give developers `kms:Encrypt` permission but deny `kms:Decrypt` permission on the production key.
B. Share the production key's material with the developers.
C. This is not possible; users who can encrypt can always decrypt.
D. Create an IAM role for the production application and have developers assume the role.

Answer: A

Explanation: KMS permissions are granular. You can create an IAM policy that allows a user or role to perform only the `kms:Encrypt`, `kms:ReEncrypt*`, and `kms:GenerateDataKey*` actions. By explicitly denying the `kms:Decrypt` action, you allow developers to encrypt data with the key without giving them the ability to decrypt any data protected by that same key.
---
Question #: 461
Which of the following are characteristics of Server-Side Encryption with S3-Managed Keys (SSE-S3)? (Choose TWO)

A. It uses the AES-256 encryption standard.
B. You must create and manage the master keys in AWS KMS.
C. There is an additional charge for each encryption request.
D. It provides a baseline level of encryption with minimal configuration.
E. You must provide the encryption key with each request.

Answer: A, D

Explanation: SSE-S3 is designed to be a simple, no-cost way to encrypt data. It uses the strong AES-256 algorithm (A) and is applied as the default for all new S3 objects, requiring no configuration (D). You do not manage the keys (B), there is no extra charge (C), and you do not provide the key (E).
---
Question #: 462
When using an Application Load Balancer, what is a "Security Policy" in the context of an HTTPS listener?

A. An IAM policy that defines who can modify the listener.
B. A collection of SSL/TLS ciphers and protocols that the load balancer uses to negotiate secure connections with clients.
C. A security group attached to the load balancer.
D. A policy that requires all backend targets to use encryption.

Answer: B

Explanation: The security policy for an ELB listener determines which SSL/TLS protocols (e.g., TLS 1.2, TLS 1.3) and ciphers (e.g., AES256-GCM-SHA384) are supported for the client-facing connection. AWS provides predefined security policies with varying levels of security and compatibility.
---
Question #: 463
If you enable encryption on an Amazon EFS (Elastic File System) file system, how is the data encrypted?

A. Using an SSL/TLS certificate.
B. Using an AWS KMS key.
C. Using a key provided by the customer with each file write.
D. EFS does not support encryption at rest.

Answer: B

Explanation: Amazon EFS integrates with AWS KMS to provide encryption at rest. When you create a new file system, you can enable encryption. EFS then uses an AWS KMS key (either `aws/elasticfilesystem` or a customer-managed key) to encrypt all data and metadata written to the file system.
---
Question #: 464
What is the primary purpose of a KMS grant?

A. To create a new KMS key.
B. To allow long-term, cross-account access to a key.
C. To delegate temporary, specific permissions for a KMS key to an AWS principal, often used by services on your behalf.
D. To pay for KMS usage.

Answer: C

Explanation: A grant is a policy instrument that gives an AWS principal temporary permission to use a KMS key. They are often used by AWS services (like S3 or EBS) to get the permissions they need to use a key on your behalf for a specific task (e.g., encrypting an object). Grants are an alternative to key policies and are ideal for programmatic, temporary delegation.
---
Question #: 465
You are creating a new RDS database from an encrypted snapshot. Can the new database be unencrypted?

A. Yes, you can choose to disable encryption during the restore process.
B. No, a database restored from an encrypted snapshot must also be encrypted.
C. Yes, but only if you have the `rds:RemoveEncryption` IAM permission.
D. No, unless you first export the data to S3 and re-import it.

Answer: B

Explanation: AWS enforces that the security posture cannot be weakened during a restore operation. If a snapshot is encrypted, any database instance created from it must also be encrypted. You can choose to encrypt it with a different key, but you cannot remove encryption.
---
Question #: 466
You are using a symmetric customer-managed KMS key. Who is responsible for the key material?

A. Only you, the customer, are responsible.
B. Only AWS is responsible.
C. AWS is responsible for generating and managing the key material within the HSM.
D. It is a shared responsibility; you must back up the key material.

Answer: C

Explanation: For a standard customer-managed key, AWS is responsible for the entire lifecycle of the key material. It is generated securely inside the KMS Hardware Security Modules (HSMs), used within the HSMs, and is never exposed in plaintext outside of them. You control access to the key via policies, but AWS manages the underlying material.
---
Question #: 467
An EC2 instance needs to retrieve a secret (like a database password) to connect to an RDS database. What is the most secure way to provide this secret to the instance, ensuring it is encrypted at rest and in transit?

A. Store the secret in a text file on an encrypted EBS volume.
B. Hardcode the secret in the application's source code.
C. Store the secret in AWS Secrets Manager and grant the instance's IAM role permission to retrieve it.
D. Pass the secret to the instance via EC2 User Data.

Answer: C

Explanation: AWS Secrets Manager is the purpose-built service for this scenario. It stores secrets encrypted at rest using AWS KMS. An application running on EC2 can be given an IAM role that grants it permission to call the Secrets Manager API. The retrieval of the secret over the API is encrypted in transit using TLS. This avoids hardcoding secrets and provides a manageable, auditable solution.
---
Question #: 468
You have a CloudFront distribution serving content from an S3 bucket. You want to ensure that the connection between clients and CloudFront is encrypted. What should you configure?

A. Enable default encryption on the S3 bucket.
B. Configure the CloudFront distribution with an SSL/TLS certificate from ACM.
C. Use a signed URL to access the content.
D. Configure the CloudFront distribution to use an OAI (Origin Access Identity).

Answer: B

Explanation: To enable HTTPS for your custom domain in CloudFront, you must attach an SSL/TLS certificate. The easiest way to do this is by requesting a public certificate from AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) and associating it with your CloudFront distribution in the viewer certificate settings.
---
Question #: 469
What is a multi-region KMS key?

A. A key that can be used to encrypt resources in any AWS region.
B. A set of interoperable KMS keys with the same key ID and key material that are replicated to different AWS regions.
C. A key that is stored in a central region and accessed globally.
D. A key that is automatically backed up to multiple regions.

Answer: B

Explanation: Multi-region keys are a KMS feature designed for client-side encryption scenarios where you need to encrypt data in one region and decrypt it in another. You create a primary multi-region key and then replicate it to other regions. The resulting keys share the same key ID and material, allowing ciphertext from one region to be decrypted in another without making cross-region API calls.
---
Question #: 470
You have enabled encryption for an SQS queue using an AWS-managed KMS key (`alias/aws/sqs`). Who needs permission to use this key for messages to be sent and received?

A. Only the message producers need `kms:GenerateDataKey` permission.
B. Both the message producers (`kms:GenerateDataKey`) and consumers (`kms:Decrypt`) need permissions.
C. Only the SQS service itself needs permission.
D. No one needs KMS permissions, as it's an AWS-managed key.

Answer: B

Explanation: Even when using an AWS-managed key, the principals (users or roles) that are sending and receiving messages must have the appropriate KMS permissions. A principal sending a message needs `kms:GenerateDataKey` and `kms:Encrypt` permissions to encrypt the message. A principal receiving a message needs `kms:Decrypt` permission to read its contents.
---
Question #: 471
Which of the following is NOT a benefit of using envelope encryption?

A. It reduces the need to protect the master key, as it is only used once.
B. It combines the performance benefits of symmetric encryption with the strong access controls of a managed master key.
C. It allows you to encrypt data larger than the 4 KB limit of the direct KMS `Encrypt` API.
D. It provides a unique encryption key for every piece of data, limiting the impact of a compromised data key.

Answer: A

Explanation: Envelope encryption absolutely does not reduce the need to protect the master key. The security of the entire system relies on the master key in KMS being secure and well-protected. The other statements are all key benefits of the envelope encryption pattern.
---
Question #: 472
A company wants to encrypt an RDS for SQL Server database and needs to support Transparent Data Encryption (TDE). How can this be integrated with AWS services?

A. RDS for SQL Server does not support TDE in AWS.
B. By using AWS KMS to manage the keys that SQL Server uses for TDE.
C. By using AWS Certificate Manager to issue a certificate for TDE.
D. By storing the TDE keys in AWS Secrets Manager.

Answer: B

Explanation: Amazon RDS for SQL Server supports Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) and is integrated with AWS KMS. You can select a KMS key, and RDS will use it to protect the Database Encryption Key (DEK) that SQL Server uses to perform the TDE. This provides a managed and auditable solution for TDE key protection.
---
Question #: 473
What is the best way to secure data in transit between a CloudFront distribution and a custom origin server (e.g., an EC2 instance)?

A. By configuring the origin to require HTTPS connections from CloudFront.
B. By using an Origin Access Identity (OAI).
C. By using a Lambda@Edge function to encrypt the data.
D. By using AWS Shield Advanced.

Answer: A

Explanation: To protect the connection between CloudFront and your origin (the "backend" connection), you should install an SSL/TLS certificate on your origin server and configure your CloudFront distribution's origin settings to use "HTTPS Only" for the origin protocol policy. This ensures the data is encrypted on both halves of its journey.
---
Question #: 474
You have an unencrypted S3 bucket with millions of existing objects. You have just enabled default encryption using SSE-KMS. What is the encryption status of the existing objects?

A. They are all automatically encrypted with the new default key.
B. They remain unencrypted.
C. They are scheduled for encryption, which will happen in the background over several hours.
D. They are encrypted using SSE-S3 instead.

Answer: B

Explanation: Enabling default encryption on a bucket only affects new objects that are uploaded after the setting is applied. It does not retroactively change the encryption status of any objects that already exist in the bucket. To encrypt existing objects, you would need to run a copy job (e.g., using S3 Batch Operations) to copy them in place.
---
Question #: 475
What is the purpose of the `kms:ReEncrypt` permission?

A. To allow a user to rotate a KMS key.
B. To allow a user to decrypt data with one key and immediately re-encrypt it with another key, without exposing the plaintext data.
C. To allow a user to re-encrypt an object that was already encrypted.
D. To allow a user to change the encryption context of an encrypted object.

Answer: B

Explanation: The `ReEncrypt` operation is an efficient server-side operation that decrypts ciphertext and then re-encrypts it under a new key. The key benefit is that the plaintext data is never returned to the calling client. This is useful for tasks like changing the key an object is encrypted with, such as when copying an encrypted EBS snapshot to another region.
---
Question #: 476
An EC2 instance needs to connect to an RDS database using SSL/TLS. The security group for the RDS instance allows traffic on port 3306 from the EC2 instance's security group. The connection still fails. What is a likely network-level issue?

A. The EC2 instance does not have the AWS root CA certificate.
B. The RDS database does not have encryption at rest enabled.
C. The Network ACL on either the EC2 or RDS subnet is blocking the traffic.
D. The IAM role on the EC2 instance is missing the `rds-connect` permission.

Answer: C

Explanation: While application-level configuration (A) is necessary, a common reason for any failed connection is a network block. If the security groups are correctly configured, the next place to check is the stateless Network ACLs. The NACL for the EC2 subnet (outbound) or the RDS subnet (inbound) could be blocking the traffic on port 3306.
---
Question #: 477
Which of these is a good use case for AWS Secrets Manager over storing a secret as a parameter in AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store?

A. Storing a plain text configuration string.
B. Storing a small binary file.
C. Storing database credentials that need to be automatically rotated on a schedule.
D. Storing a value that is updated multiple times per second.

Answer: C

Explanation: While both services can securely store secrets, a key feature of AWS Secrets Manager is its ability to integrate with services like RDS to automatically rotate credentials. It can change the database user's password on a schedule and update the stored secret accordingly, without manual intervention.
---
Question #: 478
When you use AWS KMS, which part of the encrypted data is logged in CloudTrail?

A. The full plaintext of the data.
B. The full ciphertext of the data.
C. Only the encryption context and information about the API call.
D. The first 1KB of the plaintext data for auditing.

Answer: C

Explanation: For security reasons, CloudTrail never logs the sensitive data (plaintext or ciphertext) that is part of a KMS API call. It logs the metadata about the request, such as the caller's identity, the key ARN, the source IP, and, importantly, the encryption context, which is very useful for auditing.
---
Question #: 479
A company uses a third-party SaaS application that needs to write encrypted data into their S3 bucket. The company wants the SaaS provider to handle the encryption but does not want to share any of its own encryption keys with the provider. Which method should be used?

A. The company creates an IAM user for the SaaS provider with `s3:PutObject` and `kms:Encrypt` permissions.
B. The SaaS provider encrypts the data client-side using its own master key.
C. The company requires the SaaS provider to use Server-Side Encryption with Customer-Provided Keys (SSE-C).
D. The company enables default SSE-S3 encryption on the bucket.

Answer: B

Explanation: If the company does not want to share any keys or grant any KMS permissions, the only option is for the SaaS provider to perform client-side encryption. The provider would use their own key management system to encrypt the data before uploading the ciphertext to the company's S3 bucket.
---
Question #: 480
Which statement accurately describes the relationship between AWS KMS and AWS CloudHSM?

A. They are two names for the same service.
B. KMS is a multi-tenant service, while CloudHSM provides single-tenant, dedicated HSMs.
C. KMS is used for encrypting data in transit, while CloudHSM is for data at rest.
D. You must use CloudHSM in order to use KMS.

Answer: B

Explanation: This is the core difference. KMS is a highly available, multi-tenant service where your keys are protected by HSMs shared across many customers (though logically isolated). CloudHSM gives you your own dedicated HSM cluster, providing a higher level of isolation and control that some compliance standards require. You can also configure KMS to use your CloudHSM cluster as a custom key store.

Question #: 481
You are encrypting an S3 object using SSE-KMS with a customer-managed key. Which of the following does S3 store with the object?

A. The plaintext data key used to encrypt the object.
B. A copy of the customer-managed KMS key.
C. The encrypted data key.
D. The key policy of the KMS key.

Answer: C

Explanation: Following the envelope encryption model, S3 calls KMS to get a unique data key. It uses the plaintext data key to encrypt the object, then discards it. It stores the *encrypted* version of the data key as metadata alongside the encrypted object.
---
Question #: 482
To ensure the authenticity and integrity of a message, you want to create a digital signature for it. Which type of KMS key would you use for this operation?

A. A symmetric key.
B. An asymmetric RSA or ECC key pair.
C. An AWS managed key.
D. A key with imported material.

Answer: B

Explanation: Digital signatures are a function of asymmetric cryptography. You use a private key to create the signature and the corresponding public key to verify it. Therefore, you would need to create an asymmetric key pair in KMS with the `SIGN_VERIFY` key usage.
---
Question #: 483
You have an unencrypted RDS database. You create a new read replica from this database. Can you encrypt the read replica?

A. Yes, you can choose to encrypt the read replica during its creation.
B. No, a read replica must have the same encryption state as its source instance.
C. Yes, but you must first encrypt the source instance.
D. No, read replicas cannot be encrypted.

Answer: B

Explanation: A read replica inherits the encryption state of its source database instance. You cannot create an encrypted read replica from an unencrypted source, nor can you create an unencrypted replica from an encrypted source. To have an encrypted replica, you must first encrypt the source instance (by using the snapshot copy-and-restore method).
---
Question #: 484
A security group is a firewall for an EC2 instance. What is the equivalent "firewall" for a KMS key?

A. An IAM Policy
B. A Security Group
C. A Network ACL
D. A Key Policy

Answer: D

Explanation: A Key Policy is a resource-based policy attached directly to a KMS key. It is the primary and mandatory mechanism for controlling who can access and use that specific key. It functions as the main firewall for the key.
---
Question #: 485
Which of the following services can have its data encrypted at rest using AWS KMS?

A. Amazon S3
B. Amazon EBS
C. Amazon RDS
D. All of the above.

Answer: D

Explanation: AWS KMS is deeply integrated with a wide range of AWS services to provide encryption at rest. This includes storage services like S3 and EBS, database services like RDS and DynamoDB, and many others.
---
Question #: 486
What is a potential risk of using Server-Side Encryption with Customer-Provided Keys (SSE-C)?

A. The encryption algorithm used (AES-256) is weaker than that used by KMS.
B. If you lose the encryption key, you lose access to your data permanently.
C. It results in higher costs due to API calls to KMS.
D. The performance is significantly lower than other encryption methods.

Answer: B

Explanation: With SSE-C, the entire responsibility for key management, durability, and availability rests with you, the customer. AWS does not store the key. If you misplace or lose the key for an object, there is absolutely no way to recover it, and the object's data is lost forever.
---
Question #: 487
You are setting up an HTTPS listener on an Application Load Balancer. Where can you source the required SSL/TLS certificate from? (Choose TWO)

A. AWS Key Management Service (KMS)
B. AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)
C. AWS Secrets Manager
D. A third-party Certificate Authority, which you then import into ACM.
E. AWS CloudHSM

Answer: B, D

Explanation: When configuring an ELB listener, you can either choose a certificate that you have provisioned directly within AWS Certificate Manager (B), or you can obtain a certificate from a third-party CA and then import it into ACM for use with the ELB (D).
---
Question #: 488
What happens if you try to use a KMS key from the `us-east-1` region to encrypt an EBS volume in the `us-west-2` region?

A. The operation succeeds, but with higher latency.
B. The operation fails because KMS keys are regional resources.
C. The operation succeeds if you have cross-region replication enabled on the key.
D. The operation succeeds, but you will incur data transfer charges.

Answer: B

Explanation: AWS KMS keys are strictly regional. A key created in one region can only be used to encrypt resources within that same region. To encrypt a resource in `us-west-2`, you must use a key that exists in `us-west-2`.
---
Question #: 489
You want to give an IAM user permission to enable and disable a specific KMS key, but nothing else. Which two IAM permissions should you grant? (Choose TWO)

A. `kms:EnableKey`
B. `kms:RotateKey`
C. `kms:DisableKey`
D. `kms:ScheduleKeyDeletion`
E. `kms:CreateKey`

Answer: A, C

Explanation: The permissions for enabling and disabling keys map directly to the API calls: `kms:EnableKey` and `kms:DisableKey`. You would create a policy granting these two actions and specify the ARN of the specific key in the `Resource` element.
---
Question #: 490
The AWS "Shared Responsibility Model" defines security responsibilities. In the context of using SSE-KMS, what is AWS responsible for?

A. Managing the IAM policies for users who access the key.
B. Securing the underlying hardware and software of the KMS service.
C. Deciding who should have access to the key.
D. Rotating the key material on a schedule you define.

Answer: B

Explanation: Under the Shared Responsibility Model, AWS is responsible for the security *of* the cloud. This includes the physical security of the data centers and the security of the underlying infrastructure that runs the KMS service, including the HSMs. You, the customer, are responsible for security *in* the cloud, which includes configuring key policies and IAM policies (A, C) and configuring rotation (D).
---
Question #: 491
Which of the following is a feature of AWS Secrets Manager but NOT AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store (Standard tier)?

A. Storing secrets encrypted with a KMS key.
B. Automatic rotation of secrets.
C. Versioning of secrets.
D. Storing secrets as key-value pairs.

Answer: B

Explanation: The flagship feature of AWS Secrets Manager is its native capability to automatically rotate secrets, such as database credentials or API keys, by integrating with services like RDS and Lambda. While Parameter Store can also store encrypted secrets, it does not have this built-in automatic rotation functionality.
---
Question #: 492
If you want to encrypt the root EBS volume of an EC2 instance, when must you specify the encryption setting?

A. You can encrypt it at any time after the instance is running.
B. Only when the instance is in the "stopped" state.
C. You must specify that the root volume should be encrypted at the time you launch the instance.
D. You must launch from an AMI that has an encrypted root volume snapshot.

Answer: C

Explanation: You cannot encrypt the root volume of an instance after it has been launched. The decision to encrypt the root volume must be made during the launch process, typically by selecting an AMI that has an encrypted snapshot or by specifying encryption settings in the storage configuration of the launch wizard.
---
Question #: 493
A company is migrating an application to AWS. The application uses a PKCS#11 compatible on-premises HSM. They want to maintain this compatibility in the cloud. Which AWS service should they use for their encryption keys?

A. AWS KMS
B. AWS Secrets Manager
C. AWS Certificate Manager
D. AWS CloudHSM

Answer: D

Explanation: AWS CloudHSM provides industry-standard HSMs that support common APIs, including PKCS#11, Java Cryptography Extensions (JCE), and Microsoft CryptoNG (CNG). This allows companies to migrate applications that use these standard interfaces with minimal changes to their code.
---
Question #: 494
You are using an Application Load Balancer with an HTTPS listener. For compliance reasons, you must not use TLS protocol version 1.0 or 1.1. How do you enforce this?

A. By configuring a WAF rule to block older TLS versions.
B. By selecting a Security Policy for the listener that only includes TLS 1.2 and higher.
C. By configuring the security group of the load balancer.
D. By modifying the configuration of the backend EC2 instances.

Answer: B

Explanation: The supported TLS protocols and ciphers for an ALB listener are controlled by its Security Policy. AWS provides several predefined policies. You would choose a modern policy, such as `ELBSecurityPolicy-TLS-1-2-2017-01` or a newer one, which explicitly disables the older, less secure TLS versions.
---
Question #: 495
What is the primary purpose of using an S3 Bucket Key for SSE-KMS?

A. To increase the security of the encryption.
B. To reduce the cost and latency of KMS requests.
C. To allow cross-region replication of encrypted objects.
D. To enable client-side encryption.

Answer: B

Explanation: Standard SSE-KMS requires one API call to KMS for every object read or written. For high-volume workloads, this can lead to significant KMS API costs and potential throttling. The S3 Bucket Key feature drastically reduces this by creating a temporary bucket-level key, which reduces the need to call KMS for every single object, thus lowering both cost and latency.
---
Question #: 496
When you import your own key material into a KMS key, what are you responsible for? (Choose TWO)

A. Ensuring the key material is generated from a secure random source.
B. Creating a secure backup of the key material outside of AWS.
C. Ensuring the key material is in the correct format (256-bit symmetric key).
D. AWS is responsible for all aspects of imported key material.
E. Scheduling the rotation of the key material within KMS.

Answer: A, B

Explanation: When you use the BYOK (Bring Your Own Key) feature, the responsibility for the key material's lifecycle outside of AWS is yours. This includes generating it securely (A) and maintaining a secure backup (B), because AWS cannot recover it for you if you delete it from the KMS key. Once imported, you are also responsible for manual rotation by importing new key material.
---
Question #: 497
You want to ensure that traffic between your CloudFront distribution and your S3 origin is NOT sent over the public internet. What feature allows this?

A. Using a custom domain name for your CloudFront distribution.
B. Using an Origin Access Identity (OAI) or Origin Access Control (OAC).
C. Enabling default encryption on the S3 bucket.
D. This is not possible; CloudFront always accesses S3 over the internet.

Answer: B

Explanation: While the connection is always encrypted with TLS, an Origin Access Identity (OAI) or the newer Origin Access Control (OAC) provides a more significant security benefit. It allows you to create a special CloudFront identity and then lock down your S3 bucket policy so that it ONLY accepts connections from that CloudFront identity. This prevents anyone from bypassing CloudFront and accessing your S3 objects directly using the S3 URL. This communication path is over the private AWS backbone.
---
Question #: 498
An application is encrypting data with a KMS key. Suddenly, all encryption requests start failing with a throttling error. What is the most likely cause?

A. The KMS key has been disabled or deleted.
B. The application's IAM role has lost its permissions to the key.
C. The application is exceeding the KMS request rate limit for the account and region.
D. The KMS service is down in that region.

Answer: C

Explanation: KMS enforces request quotas (requests per second) to ensure the performance and availability of the service for all customers. If an application suddenly makes a very high volume of API calls (e.g., `Encrypt`, `Decrypt`, `GenerateDataKey`), it can exceed these limits, and KMS will start throttling the requests, returning a `ThrottlingException` error.
---
Question #: 499
An e-commerce application needs to process orders. The order creation service needs to notify multiple downstream services—such as shipping, inventory, and analytics—simultaneously whenever a new order is placed. Which AWS service combination is best suited for this "fan-out" messaging pattern?

A. SQS Standard Queue -> Multiple Lambda Functions
B. SNS Topic -> Multiple SQS Queues (one for each service) -> Lambda Functions
C. Kinesis Data Stream -> Multiple Consumers
D. SQS FIFO Queue -> A single Lambda Function that calls other services

Answer: B

Explanation: This is the classic fan-out use case. An SNS topic allows you to publish a single message that is then delivered to multiple subscribers. By having each downstream service subscribe to the topic with its own SQS queue, you ensure that each service receives the message independently and can process it at its own pace, providing durability and decoupling.
---
Question #: 500
A fleet of EC2 instances is polling an SQS Standard queue for messages. The instances report that they are often receiving empty responses, which is increasing costs due to wasted CPU cycles. What SQS feature should be configured to reduce the number of empty responses?

A. Increase the Message Retention Period.
B. Enable Long Polling by setting a Receive Message Wait Time greater than 0.
C. Decrease the Visibility Timeout.
D. Configure a Dead-Letter Queue (DLQ).

Answer: B

Explanation: Long polling is the solution for this problem. When a consumer requests a message from an SQS queue, long polling allows SQS to wait for a specified time (up to 20 seconds) for a message to become available before sending a response. This significantly reduces the number of empty responses and is more cost-effective than short polling (the default).
---
Question #: 501
A Lambda function is configured with an SQS standard queue as its event source. A message in the queue is processed by the Lambda function, but the function experiences an unhandled exception and fails before the message can be deleted. What happens to the message?

A. The message is immediately moved to the Dead-Letter Queue (DLQ).
B. The message is deleted from the queue to prevent reprocessing.
C. The message becomes visible again in the queue after the Visibility Timeout expires, and it will be processed again.
D. The message remains in the queue but is marked as "failed" and will not be picked up again.

Answer: C

Explanation: SQS uses a visibility timeout to handle processing failures. When a consumer (like Lambda) receives a message, the message becomes invisible. If the consumer does not explicitly delete the message before the visibility timeout expires, SQS assumes the processing failed, and the message becomes visible again for another consumer to process.
---
Question #: 502
An application needs to send notifications to a wide variety of subscribers, including a web application via HTTPS, an email distribution list, and a mobile application via push notifications. Which service can send a single message to all these different endpoint types?

A. Amazon SQS
B. Amazon MQ
C. Amazon SNS
D. Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose

Answer: C

Explanation: Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service) is designed to deliver messages to a wide array of subscriber types. A single SNS topic can have subscriptions for different protocols, including HTTPS, Email, SMS, SQS, and mobile push notifications, making it the ideal choice for multi-channel notifications.
---
Question #: 503
What is the primary architectural benefit of using a message queue like Amazon SQS between a web application front-end and a backend processing service?

A. It encrypts the data in transit between the front-end and backend.
B. It decouples the components, allowing the backend service to fail or scale independently of the front-end.
C. It guarantees the order in which messages are processed.
D. It provides a way to directly invoke the backend service from the front-end.

Answer: B

Explanation: Decoupling is the main advantage. The front-end can quickly add a job message to the queue and move on, providing a fast user experience. The backend can then process these jobs at its own rate. If the backend is slow, overloaded, or even temporarily offline, the jobs are safely stored in the queue, and no data is lost. This resilience is a key feature of decoupled architectures.
---
Question #: 504
You need to process a stream of financial transactions where the exact order of operations is critical. If a transaction is processed more than once, it could cause serious data inconsistencies. Which SQS queue type should you use?

A. SQS Standard Queue
B. SQS FIFO Queue
C. SQS Delay Queue
D. SQS Dead-Letter Queue

Answer: B

Explanation: SQS FIFO (First-In, First-Out) queues are designed for use cases where the order of operations is critical and exactly-once processing is required. They guarantee that messages are processed in the order they are sent and prevent duplicates from being introduced into the queue.
---
Question #: 505
An SNS topic is configured to send messages to a subscribed SQS queue. However, the SQS queue's resource policy is misconfigured and does not allow the SNS topic to send messages to it. What will happen to messages published to the SNS topic?

A. The messages will be queued within SNS and retried for up to 24 hours.
B. The publish call to the SNS topic will fail.
C. The messages will be lost, but SNS will log the delivery failure.
D. The messages will be automatically rerouted to a Dead-Letter Queue if one is configured on the SNS subscription.

Answer: D

Explanation: SNS subscriptions can be configured with a Dead-Letter Queue (DLQ). If SNS fails to deliver a message to a subscriber's endpoint (like an SQS queue with a bad policy), and a DLQ is configured for that subscription, SNS will move the undeliverable message to the DLQ for later analysis. If no DLQ is configured, the message will be lost (after some retries).
---
Question #: 506
A Lambda function needs to be triggered whenever a new image file (.jpg or .png) is uploaded to a specific folder (`/uploads/`) in an S3 bucket. How should this be configured?

A. Configure the Lambda function to poll the S3 bucket every second.
B. Configure S3 Event Notifications for the bucket with a prefix filter for `/uploads/` and a suffix filter for `.jpg` and `.png` to invoke the Lambda function.
C. Use an SNS topic to subscribe to S3 changes and trigger the Lambda.
D. Use a CloudWatch alarm to monitor the bucket size and trigger the Lambda.

Answer: B

Explanation: Amazon S3 Event Notifications is the native, event-driven way to achieve this. You can configure the bucket to send an event directly to a Lambda function whenever a specific action occurs (like `s3:ObjectCreated:*`). The configuration can be refined with prefix and suffix filters to ensure the function is only invoked for specific objects in specific locations.
---
Question #: 507
What is the "visibility timeout" in Amazon SQS?

A. The maximum time a message can remain in the queue before it is deleted.
B. The period of time during which SQS prevents other consumers from receiving and processing a message that has been picked up by one consumer.
C. The time SQS will wait for a message to arrive before returning an empty response (long polling).
D. The delay before a new message sent to the queue becomes visible to consumers.

Answer: B

Explanation: The visibility timeout is a crucial part of SQS's distributed nature. When a consumer receives a message, that message is hidden from other consumers for the duration of the visibility timeout. This prevents multiple consumers from processing the same message simultaneously. If the consumer fails to delete the message before the timeout expires, the message becomes visible again.
---
Question #: 508
An SNS topic sends messages to a Lambda function. The Lambda function is experiencing a high error rate and is failing to process many of the messages. What is the default retry behavior of SNS for a Lambda subscription?

A. SNS will not retry; the message is lost immediately.
B. SNS will attempt to deliver the message a total of 3 times before giving up.
C. SNS will retry the delivery, with backoff, for a total of 100,015 times over 23 days.
D. SNS will place the message in an SQS queue for the Lambda to poll.

Answer: C

Explanation: SNS has a very robust retry policy for asynchronous subscribers like Lambda. It will attempt to deliver the message multiple times with an exponential backoff strategy, continuing for many hours and even days, to ensure the message is delivered if the downstream system recovers.
---
Question #: 509
Which of the following are valid subscriber types for an Amazon SNS topic? (Choose TWO)

A. Amazon EC2 Instance
B. AWS Lambda function
C. Amazon SQS queue
D. Amazon RDS Database
E. An Elastic IP Address

Answer: B, C

Explanation: SNS supports a wide variety of subscribers. Among the options, AWS Lambda functions (B) and Amazon SQS queues (C) are two of the most common and powerful subscription types used in decoupled, event-driven architectures. You cannot subscribe an EC2 instance directly; you would typically have an application on the instance subscribe via HTTP/S.
---
Question #: 510
A batch processing application uses an SQS Standard queue. The application is designed to be idempotent, meaning processing the same message multiple times has no adverse effect. However, the developers notice that, on rare occasions, a single job message is processed by two different worker instances. What is the cause of this?

A. This is a known issue with the SQS FIFO queue.
B. This is a characteristic of the distributed nature of SQS Standard queues, which provide "at-least-once" delivery.
C. The visibility timeout is set too high.
D. The SQS queue's permissions are misconfigured.

Answer: B

Explanation: SQS Standard queues are designed for high throughput and offer at-least-once delivery. This means that, due to the highly distributed nature of the system, a message might occasionally be delivered more than once. Applications using Standard queues should be designed to be idempotent to handle this possibility. FIFO queues, in contrast, provide exactly-once processing.
---
Question #: 511
An application uploads a file to S3, which should trigger a series of five sequential processing steps, each performed by a different Lambda function. What is the best way to orchestrate this multi-step workflow?

A. Use an SNS topic with five Lambda subscribers.
B. Chain the Lambda functions, where the first function directly invokes the second, the second invokes the third, and so on.
C. Use AWS Step Functions to define a state machine that orchestrates the sequence of Lambda invocations.
D. Use a single SQS queue that all five Lambda functions poll.

Answer: C

Explanation: AWS Step Functions is the purpose-built service for orchestrating multi-step workflows. You can define your workflow as a state machine, where each state can be a task like invoking a Lambda function. Step Functions manages the state, handles errors and retries, and ensures the steps are executed in the correct order, which is much more robust and manageable than manually chaining Lambda functions (B).
---
Question #: 512
You are designing an application that sends a daily report to thousands of users via email. The user list is managed in a database. What is the most scalable way to send the emails?

A. Write a script on an EC2 instance that queries the database and sends emails one by one using Amazon SES.
B. Create an SNS topic, subscribe all user email addresses to the topic, and publish the report to the topic once.
C. Use SQS to queue each email address and have a Lambda function send the emails.
D. Use Amazon Pinpoint to manage the user segments and send the email campaign.

Answer: B

Explanation: Amazon SNS is designed for mass notifications. While other options can work, the simplest and most direct approach for this use case is to subscribe each user's email address to an SNS topic. When you publish the report message to the topic, SNS handles the delivery to all subscribers in a highly scalable and parallel manner.
---
Question #: 513
What is the function of an SQS "Dead-Letter Queue" (DLQ)?

A. It is a queue where you send messages that you want to delete immediately.
B. It is a queue that other queues can target to receive messages that have failed processing a specified number of times.
C. It is a special FIFO queue that stores failed messages in order.
D. It is a queue with a zero-second retention period.

Answer: B

Explanation: A DLQ is a critical feature for handling message failures gracefully. You configure a source queue so that if a message is received from the queue a certain number of times (the `maxReceiveCount`) without being deleted, SQS will automatically move the "poison pill" message to the designated DLQ. This prevents a bad message from blocking the queue and allows developers to inspect and debug failed messages separately.
---
Question #: 514
An application publishes a message to an SNS topic. The topic has three SQS queue subscribers and one Lambda function subscriber. How many times is the message stored and delivered?

A. The message is delivered once to the first available subscriber.
B. The message is delivered four times, once to each of the four subscribers.
C. The message is stored once in SNS and then read by all subscribers.
D. The message is delivered three times to the SQS queues, and the Lambda function reads from one of them.

Answer: B

Explanation: This demonstrates the "fan-out" pattern. SNS takes the single published message and creates a copy for each of its subscribers. It then attempts to deliver a copy of the message to each of the three SQS queues and the one Lambda function independently.
---
Question #: 515
A Lambda function that processes SQS messages needs permission to delete a message from the queue after successful processing. Which IAM permission is required in the function's execution role?

A. `sqs:ReceiveMessage`
B. `sqs:SendMessage`
C. `sqs:DeleteMessage`
D. `sqs:PurgeQueue`

Answer: C

Explanation: The Lambda service polls the queue on your behalf (using `ReceiveMessage`). To complete the message lifecycle, your function's execution role must have permission to call the `DeleteMessage` API action on the specific SQS queue it is processing. Without this, messages would become visible again after the visibility timeout and be processed repeatedly.
---
Question #: 516
You need to send a message to an SQS queue that should not be visible to any consumer for the first 10 minutes. What feature should you use?

A. Visibility Timeout
B. Message Timer
C. Delay Queue
D. Long Polling

Answer: C

Explanation: A Delay Queue is a queue-level setting that postpones the delivery of all new messages sent to that queue for a configured amount of time (from 0 seconds to 15 minutes). Message Timers (B) apply this delay on a per-message basis, but a Delay Queue (C) applies it to the entire queue. Visibility Timeout (A) applies after a message has been received.
---
Question #: 517
Which AWS service allows you to filter messages published to a topic so that subscribers only receive a subset of the messages they are interested in?

A. Amazon SQS
B. Amazon SNS
C. AWS Lambda
D. Amazon Kinesis

Answer: B

Explanation: Amazon SNS supports subscription filter policies. When a subscriber creates a subscription to a topic, it can provide a JSON policy that specifies attributes of the messages it wants to receive. When a message is published with message attributes, SNS will evaluate the filter policies of its subscribers and only deliver the message to those whose policy matches the message attributes.
---
Question #: 518
A Lambda function is invoked asynchronously (e.g., from an S3 event). The function fails due to a bug in the code. What is the default retry behavior for asynchronous Lambda invocations?

A. Lambda does not retry failed asynchronous invocations.
B. Lambda will retry the invocation two more times, with a delay between retries.
C. Lambda will retry the invocation indefinitely until it succeeds.
D. Lambda will send the failed event to an SNS topic.

Answer: B

Explanation: For asynchronous invocations, the Lambda service has a built-in retry mechanism. If the function returns an error, Lambda will automatically retry the invocation twice, with a 1-minute wait before the first retry and a 2-minute wait before the second. If all three attempts fail, the event may be sent to a configured Dead-Letter Queue or a Lambda Destination.
---
Question #: 519
What is a key difference between SQS and SNS?

A. SQS is a "pull" based system (consumers poll for messages), while SNS is a "push" based system (messages are pushed to subscribers).
B. SQS guarantees message ordering, while SNS does not.
C. SQS can have multiple subscribers, while SNS can only have one.
D. SQS is a regional service, while SNS is a global service.

Answer: A

Explanation: This is a fundamental difference in their models. With SQS, you must have a consumer application that actively polls the queue to ask for messages. With SNS, you set up subscriptions, and SNS actively pushes the message out to the subscribed endpoints when a message is published.
---
Question #: 520
An event-driven application uses a Lambda function to process files uploaded to S3. The function is occasionally timing out when processing very large files. What is the best way to re-architect this to handle large files gracefully?

A. Increase the Lambda function's timeout to the maximum of 15 minutes.
B. Increase the Lambda function's memory allocation.
C. Create a multi-step workflow using AWS Step Functions, where the first Lambda function analyzes the file and subsequent states process it in chunks.
D. Switch from S3 events to polling the bucket from an EC2 instance.

Answer: C

Explanation: While increasing the timeout and memory (A, B) might help, it's not a robust solution for arbitrarily large files. A better, more scalable architecture is to use AWS Step Functions. The initial S3 event can trigger a Step Function state machine. The first state (a Lambda function) can inspect the file and, if it's large, set up a loop within the state machine to process the file in manageable chunks using subsequent Lambda invocations.
---
Question #: 521
When using an SQS FIFO queue, what is a "Message Group ID"?

A. The unique identifier for the SQS queue itself.
B. A tag or label that associates a message with a specific ordered message group. All messages with the same Message Group ID are processed in strict order.
C. The ID of the consumer that is currently processing the message.
D. An attribute that determines the priority of the message.

Answer: B

Explanation: The Message Group ID is a key feature of FIFO queues that allows for parallel but ordered processing. While the queue as a whole guarantees FIFO order, messages with the *same* Message Group ID are delivered to consumers in the exact order they were sent. Messages with *different* Message Group IDs can be processed in parallel. This allows you to have multiple ordered streams within a single queue.
---
Question #: 522
You have an SNS topic with a single HTTP/S endpoint subscriber. The endpoint is occasionally unavailable due to deployments. What feature should you configure to avoid losing notifications?

A. Enable long polling on the SNS topic.
B. Configure a Dead-Letter Queue (DLQ) for the SNS subscription.
C. Increase the SNS topic's message retention period.
D. Switch the endpoint to use the POST method instead of GET.

Answer: B

Explanation: Since the endpoint can be unavailable, there's a risk that SNS will fail all of its delivery retries and discard the message. To prevent this data loss, you should configure a DLQ (an SQS queue) on the SNS subscription itself. If SNS is unable to deliver the message to the HTTP endpoint after all its retries, it will move the message to the DLQ for later processing.
---
Question #: 523
A Lambda function processes events from a Kinesis Data Stream. It is configured with a batch size of 100. During one invocation, the function successfully processes the first 50 records but then throws an error. What happens to the records in that batch?

A. The entire batch of 100 records is re-processed in the next invocation.
B. Only the 50 unprocessed records are re-processed.
C. The entire batch is sent to the configured Dead-Letter Queue.
D. The first 50 records are checkpointed, and processing continues with the next batch.

Answer: A

Explanation: By default, if a Lambda function processing a Kinesis or DynamoDB stream returns an error, the entire batch of records is re-processed. The Lambda service will retry the batch with the same records until it succeeds or the data expires from the stream. To change this behavior, you can enable "bisect batch on function error", which will split the failed batch and retry the halves to isolate the bad record.
---
Question #: 524
What is the maximum size of a message that can be sent to Amazon SQS or Amazon SNS?

A. 64 KB
B. 256 KB
C. 1 MB
D. 10 MB

Answer: B

Explanation: The maximum payload size for a single message in both SQS and SNS is 256 KB of text data (in UTF-8 format). For larger payloads, the common pattern is to store the payload in a service like S3 and then send a message containing a pointer (the S3 object key) to the payload.

Question #: 525
An application needs to publish a message that will be consumed by three different microservices. Each microservice team wants to manage its own consumption logic and be able to replay messages if needed, without affecting the other services. What is the best design?

A. Create a single SQS queue that all three microservices poll.
B. Create an SNS topic and have each microservice subscribe with its own SQS queue.
C. Create a Kinesis Data Stream with three different consumer applications.
D. Create three separate SQS queues and have the publisher write the message to all three.

Answer: B

Explanation: This architecture provides the most flexibility and decoupling. Publishing to a central SNS topic means the publisher doesn't need to know anything about the consumers. Each microservice gets its own dedicated SQS queue subscribed to the topic. This isolates them from each other; one service can be down or have a large backlog without impacting the others. It also allows them to manage their own messages and re-processing logic independently.

Question #: 526
What is the "fan-out" pattern in event-driven architecture?

A. A pattern where a single event is sent to a message queue and processed by one of many competing consumers.
B. A pattern where an event triggers a chain of sequential processing steps.
C. A pattern where a single event is published and then delivered to multiple, independent downstream systems for parallel processing.
D. A pattern where multiple events are batched together and processed as a single unit.

Answer: C

Explanation: Fan-out is the concept of taking one message and distributing it to many destinations. Amazon SNS is the classic AWS service for implementing this pattern. You publish one message to an SNS topic, and it is "fanned out" to all the topic's subscribers.
---
Question #: 527
A Lambda function is configured to be triggered by an SNS topic. What does the `event` object that is passed to the Lambda handler contain?

A. The raw message string that was published to the topic.
B. An array of SQS message objects.
C. A JSON object that contains the message, message attributes, and metadata about the topic and subscription.
D. The IAM credentials of the user who published the message.

Answer: C

Explanation: When SNS invokes a Lambda function, it passes a structured JSON event. This event object is a wrapper that contains details about the source (the topic ARN), the subscription, and the message itself, including the message body, subject, and any message attributes that were published with it.
---
Question #: 528
You want to ensure that messages in an SQS queue are processed by a Lambda function in batches of 10. Which Lambda event source mapping setting do you configure?

A. `BatchSize`
B. `MaximumBatchingWindowInSeconds`
C. `ConcurrencyLimit`
D. `VisibilityTimeout`

Answer: A

Explanation: The `BatchSize` is a key setting in the event source mapping between SQS and Lambda. It specifies the maximum number of messages that the Lambda service will pull from the queue in a single batch and pass to your function in a single invocation. This is a very efficient way to process messages.
---
Question #: 529
Which two features are exclusive to SQS FIFO queues and not available in Standard queues? (Choose TWO)

A. Dead-Letter Queues (DLQs)
B. Message Groups
C. At-least-once delivery
D. Exactly-once processing
E. Long Polling

Answer: B, D

Explanation: Exactly-once processing (D) and Message Groups (B) are the defining features of FIFO queues. Exactly-once processing prevents duplicate messages, while Message Groups allow for parallel ordered streams within a single queue. Standard queues offer at-least-once delivery (C), and both queue types support DLQs (A) and Long Polling (E).
---
Question #: 530
An API Gateway endpoint needs to asynchronously trigger a long-running process without making the client wait for the process to complete. What is the most scalable and decoupled architecture?

A. API Gateway -> Synchronous Lambda invocation -> The process.
B. API Gateway -> EC2 instance that runs the process.
C. API Gateway -> SQS Queue -> Worker (EC2 or Lambda) that processes the job.
D. API Gateway -> Step Function that runs the process.

Answer: C

Explanation: To achieve an asynchronous response, the API Gateway integration should be very fast. By having API Gateway place a message directly onto an SQS queue, it can immediately return a "202 Accepted" response to the client. A separate fleet of workers (EC2 or Lambda) can then poll this queue and perform the long-running process in the background, completely decoupled from the client's request-response cycle.
---
Question #: 531
What is the maximum message retention period for an Amazon SQS queue?

A. 1 day
B. 4 days
C. 14 days
D. 30 days

Answer: C

Explanation: You can configure the message retention period for an SQS queue to be any value from 60 seconds (1 minute) to 1,209,600 seconds (14 days). The default retention period is 4 days.
---
Question #: 532
You publish a message to an SNS FIFO topic. The topic has two SQS FIFO queue subscribers. What is true about the message delivery?

A. The message is delivered to both queues in a non-deterministic order.
B. The message is delivered to both SQS FIFO queues in the exact same order relative to other messages with the same Message Group ID.
C. Only one of the queues will receive the message.
D. The message will be duplicated in each queue.

Answer: B

Explanation: SNS FIFO topics, when used with SQS FIFO queue subscribers, maintain end-to-end message ordering and deduplication. This ensures that the messages are delivered to all subscribed FIFO queues in the correct order for a given Message Group ID, providing a powerful pattern for ordered fan-out.
---
Question #: 533
A Lambda function has a "Dead-Letter Queue" (DLQ) configured, pointing to an SQS queue. Under which circumstances will an event be sent to this DLQ?

A. When the function's code successfully processes the event.
B. When a synchronous invocation of the function returns an error.
C. When an asynchronous invocation of the function fails all of its retry attempts.
D. When the function's execution role does not have permission to write to CloudWatch Logs.

Answer: C

Explanation: A Lambda DLQ is specifically for handling failures in *asynchronous* invocations. After the Lambda service has attempted to invoke the function with an event and has failed all of its configured retries (by default, a total of 3 attempts), it will then send the failed event payload to the configured DLQ (which can be an SQS queue or an SNS topic).
---
Question #: 534
What is the purpose of the `MaximumBatchingWindowInSeconds` setting for a Lambda function triggered by SQS?

A. It is the maximum amount of time the Lambda function can run.
B. It is the amount of time the Lambda service will wait to gather messages into a batch before invoking the function.
C. It is the visibility timeout for the messages in the batch.
D. It is the maximum time a message can be in the queue.

Answer: B

Explanation: This setting works in conjunction with `BatchSize`. The Lambda poller will invoke your function as soon as one of two conditions is met: either the number of messages in the batch reaches `BatchSize`, or the amount of time since it started building the batch reaches `MaximumBatchingWindowInSeconds`. This allows you to process messages quickly even if the batch size is not yet full.
---
Question #: 535
You have an SQS queue where messages must be processed by consumers within 60 seconds, or the message should be considered failed. What is the most appropriate setting to configure?

A. Message Retention Period to 60 seconds.
B. Delay Seconds to 60 seconds.
C. Visibility Timeout to 60 seconds.
D. Wait Time Seconds to 20 seconds.

Answer: C

Explanation: The Visibility Timeout defines the amount of time a consumer has to process and delete a message. By setting it to 60 seconds, you are giving your consumers a 60-second lease on the message. If they do not delete it within that time, SQS assumes it failed processing and will make it visible again for another consumer.
---
Question #: 536
Which of the following is a good use case for an SQS Standard Queue over a FIFO Queue?

A. Processing bank transactions that must be in order.
B. An application that requires exactly-once processing of tasks.
C. A high-throughput system that ingests a large volume of clickstream data where occasional message duplication is acceptable and strict ordering is not required.
D. A workflow where a user's "New Account" record must be processed before their "Update Profile" record.

Answer: C

Explanation: SQS Standard queues are optimized for maximum throughput. They are ideal for workloads where you need to process a very large number of messages and the application can tolerate at-least-once delivery and does not depend on a strict processing order. Use cases like log ingestion or clickstream data fit this model perfectly.
---
Question #: 537
A Lambda function needs to read messages from an SQS queue. What is the invocation model?

A. The Lambda function is invoked synchronously by SQS.
B. The Lambda function is invoked asynchronously by SQS.
C. The Lambda function polls the SQS queue for messages.
D. SQS pushes messages to the Lambda function, and Lambda polls the queue.

Answer: D

Explanation: This is a subtle but important point. SQS is a poll-based service. However, when you use it as a Lambda trigger, you do not write the polling logic. The Lambda service itself has a fleet of pollers that constantly poll the configured SQS queue on your behalf. When these pollers receive messages, they then invoke your Lambda function synchronously with a batch of those messages. So, from the function's perspective, it's a push, but the underlying mechanism is a managed poll.
---
Question #: 538
An SQS message is sent with a `MessageDeduplicationId` to a FIFO queue. A second message is sent with the same `MessageDeduplicationId` within the 5-minute deduplication interval. What happens?

A. The second message is accepted and placed in the queue.
B. The send call for the second message succeeds, but the message is discarded by SQS and not added to the queue.
C. The send call for the second message fails with a "Duplicate Message" error.
D. The first message is replaced by the second message.

Answer: B

Explanation: The `MessageDeduplicationId` is the mechanism SQS FIFO queues use for deduplication. If you send a message with an ID that has already been successfully processed within the 5-minute interval, SQS will accept the message (the API call returns success) but will not deliver it again. This prevents duplicates from being introduced into the system.
---
Question #: 539
A company wants to send promotional SMS text messages to its customers in over 100 countries. Which service is best suited for this?

A. Amazon SQS
B. Amazon SES (Simple Email Service)
C. Amazon SNS
D. AWS Lambda

Answer: C

Explanation: Amazon SNS has built-in support for delivering messages as SMS text messages to mobile phone numbers in over 200 countries. You can publish a message once to an SNS topic or send it directly to a phone number.
---
Question #: 540
You are building an event-driven system where a single event from a source system needs to be archived in S3, indexed in Elasticsearch, and trigger a real-time notification. What is the most decoupled way to architect this?

A. Have the source system write directly to S3, Elasticsearch, and the notification service.
B. Have the source system publish one event to an SNS topic. Configure subscriptions to a Lambda function for S3 archival, a Kinesis Data Firehose for Elasticsearch indexing, and another Lambda for notifications.
C. Have the source system write to a single Lambda function that then calls the S3, Elasticsearch, and notification APIs.
D. Have the source system write to an SQS queue polled by a single EC2 instance that handles all three tasks.

Answer: B

Explanation: This is a perfect example of the fan-out pattern for decoupling. The source system has one simple responsibility: publish an event to SNS. All the downstream logic is handled by independent subscribers. This allows you to add, remove, or change the downstream systems without ever having to modify the original source system.
---
Question #: 541
When a Lambda function is invoked synchronously, who is responsible for retrying the invocation if it fails?

A. The Lambda service automatically retries synchronous invocations.
B. The client or service that invoked the Lambda function is responsible for implementing its own retry logic.
C. The event is sent to a Dead-Letter Queue.
D. The invocation is not retried.

Answer: B

Explanation: For synchronous invocations (e.g., from an API Gateway or a direct `Invoke` call), the Lambda service returns an error directly to the caller. It does not perform automatic retries. The calling application is responsible for catching the error and deciding whether to retry the call.
---
Question #: 542
What is the primary purpose of using an SQS queue as a buffer for incoming data before it is written to a database?

A. To ensure the data is written to the database in alphabetical order.
B. To handle sudden spikes in traffic, smoothing the load on the database and preventing it from being overwhelmed.
C. To validate the data before it reaches the database.
D. To provide a public endpoint for writing data.

Answer: B

Explanation: A queue can act as a shock absorber. If you receive a sudden burst of 10,000 write requests, instead of sending them all to the database at once (which might overload it), you can place them in an SQS queue. A consumer application can then pull messages from the queue and write to the database at a sustainable, controlled rate.
---
Question #: 543
What happens if you publish a message to an SNS topic that has no subscribers?

A. The publish call fails.
B. The message is stored in the topic for 14 days, waiting for a subscriber.
C. The publish call succeeds, but the message is discarded.
D. The message is sent to a default SQS queue.

Answer: C

Explanation: An SNS topic with no subscribers is like shouting into an empty room. The publish operation will be successful (you won't get an error), but since there are no destinations to deliver the message to, the message is simply dropped.
---
Question #: 544
A Lambda function processes messages from an SQS queue. The function is configured with a batch size of 10. The queue currently contains 25 messages. How many times will the Lambda function be invoked?

A. 1 time, with all 25 messages.
B. 25 times, once for each message.
C. 3 times: two invocations with 10 messages each, and one invocation with the remaining 5 messages.
D. 2 times, with 10 messages each. The remaining 5 messages will be processed later.

Answer: C

Explanation: The Lambda polling service will read messages from the queue up to the configured batch size. It will create a batch of 10 and invoke the function. Then it will create a second batch of 10 and invoke the function again. Finally, it will create a third batch with the last 5 messages and invoke the function a third time.
---
Question #: 545
You need to create a decoupled architecture where a producer application sends tasks to be completed by a consumer application. There must be only one consumer application processing a given task at any time. Which service is most appropriate?

A. SNS topic
B. SQS queue
C. Kinesis Data Stream
D. Lambda function

Answer: B

Explanation: This describes the fundamental competing consumer pattern, which is a primary use case for a message queue. An SQS queue ensures that when a message is delivered to one consumer, the visibility timeout prevents any other consumer from receiving that same message for a period of time, guaranteeing single processing of a task.
---
Question #: 546
For a Lambda function to write logs, what must be configured in its execution role?

A. Permission to call `lambda:InvokeFunction`.
B. Permission to call `s3:PutObject`.
C. Permissions to call `logs:CreateLogGroup`, `logs:CreateLogStream`, and `logs:PutLogEvents`.
D. Permission to poll an SQS queue.

Answer: C

Explanation: Lambda functions automatically stream their output (anything written to stdout/stderr) to Amazon CloudWatch Logs. To enable this, the function's IAM execution role must have the necessary permissions to create and write to log streams within the CloudWatch Logs service. The `AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole` managed policy contains these permissions.
---
Question #: 547
What is the difference between SQS long polling and short polling?

A. Long polling can wait up to 20 seconds for a message, while short polling returns immediately, even if the queue is empty.
B. Long polling has higher latency than short polling.
C. Long polling can retrieve up to 25 messages, while short polling can only retrieve 10.
D. Long polling is the default behavior, while short polling must be enabled.

Answer: A

Explanation: Short polling (the original behavior) queries a subset of SQS servers and returns a response immediately. Long polling queries all SQS servers and can wait for a configured time (`ReceiveMessageWaitTimeSeconds`) for a message to arrive before responding. Long polling is almost always preferred as it is more efficient and reduces costs.
---
Question #: 548
Which of the following is a good use case for SNS Message Filtering?

A. An application that needs to receive all messages from a topic.
B. An image processing application where you have one topic for all image events, but different worker pools that only want to be notified about `.jpg` files or `.png` files.
C. A system that needs to guarantee the order of messages.
D. An application that wants to receive messages in batches.

Answer: B

Explanation: Message filtering allows subscribers to declare which messages they are interested in based on message attributes. In this scenario, you could publish all image creation events to a single SNS topic with a `file_extension` message attribute. The `.jpg` processing subscribers would have a filter policy for `"file_extension": ["jpg"]`, and the `.png` subscribers would have a policy for `"file_extension": ["png"]`, ensuring they only receive relevant notifications.
---
Question #: 549
You are designing a system that must process a continuous, high-volume stream of real-time data, like IoT sensor readings. The data needs to be consumed by multiple applications in parallel, and it needs to be replayable for 24 hours. Which service is the best fit?

A. Amazon SQS Standard Queue
B. Amazon SQS FIFO Queue
C. Amazon SNS Topic
D. Amazon Kinesis Data Stream

Answer: D

Explanation: While SQS and SNS are for messaging, Kinesis Data Streams is designed for real-time data streaming. Its key features include ordered records within a shard, the ability for multiple consumer applications to read the same stream in parallel, and data retention (default 24 hours, up to 365 days) that allows for replaying the data.
---
Question #: 550
What is a Lambda "Destination"?

A. The S3 bucket where the function's code is stored.
B. A resource (SQS queue, SNS topic, Lambda function, or EventBridge bus) that receives the result of a Lambda invocation.
C. The URL of the API Gateway that triggers the function.
D. The CloudWatch log group for the function.

Answer: B

Explanation: Lambda Destinations is a feature for handling the results of asynchronous invocations. You can configure a destination for "On Success" and/or "On Failure". This allows you to build more resilient event-driven applications by, for example, routing all failed invocation events directly to an SQS dead-letter queue without having to configure a separate DLQ on the Lambda function itself.
---
Question #: 551
When you send a message to an SQS FIFO queue, what two parameters are required that are not needed for a Standard queue?

A. `MessageBody` and `QueueUrl`
B. `MessageGroupId` and `MessageDeduplicationId`
C. `DelaySeconds` and `VisibilityTimeout`
D. `MessageAttributes` and `MessageGroupId`

Answer: B

Explanation: To maintain order and ensure exactly-once processing, FIFO queues require additional information. The `MessageGroupId` is used to define which ordered stream the message belongs to. The `MessageDeduplicationId` is used by SQS to prevent duplicate messages from being processed.
---
Question #: 552
An S3 bucket is configured with an event notification that sends a message to an SNS topic. The SNS topic has an SQS queue and a Lambda function as subscribers. The IAM Role for the S3 event notification has permission to publish to the SNS topic. The SQS queue policy does not grant SNS permission. What happens when a file is uploaded to S3?

A. The entire process fails; S3 cannot publish to SNS.
B. S3 successfully publishes to the SNS topic. The message is delivered to the Lambda function, but not to the SQS queue.
C. S3 successfully publishes to the SNS topic, but no subscribers receive the message.
D. The S3 event notification fails silently.

Answer: B

Explanation: The event delivery is a series of independent steps. S3 has permission to publish to SNS, so that step will succeed. SNS will then attempt to deliver the message to its subscribers. It has implicit permission to invoke a Lambda function in the same account. However, since the SQS queue's resource policy is missing the required permission, the delivery to the queue will fail. The delivery to the Lambda function will succeed independently.
---
Question #: 553
You need to build a system that polls a third-party API every 5 minutes to check for new data. What is the most serverless and cost-effective way to schedule this task?

A. Run a cron job on an EC2 instance that is always on.
B. Use an Amazon EventBridge (CloudWatch Events) rule with a "rate(5 minutes)" schedule to trigger a Lambda function.
C. Launch a new EC2 instance every 5 minutes using a scheduled Auto Scaling action.
D. Use a continuous loop in a Lambda function with a 5-minute sleep timer.

Answer: B

Explanation: This is a perfect use case for a scheduled EventBridge rule. You can define a rule that runs on a fixed schedule (e.g., a rate or a cron expression) and set its target to be your Lambda function. This is fully serverless, so you only pay for the few seconds the Lambda function runs every 5 minutes, making it extremely cost-effective compared to an always-on EC2 instance.
---
Question #: 554
A developer wants to test an SNS topic that sends notifications to an SQS queue. What is the easiest way to see the raw message that SNS delivers to the SQS queue?

A. Use the "Publish Message" button in the SNS console and then use the "Poll for messages" feature in the SQS console.
B. Write a Lambda function to read the message and log it to CloudWatch.
C. Check the CloudTrail logs for the SNS publish event.
D. Use the AWS CLI to subscribe an email address and inspect the email.

Answer: A

Explanation: The AWS Management Console provides simple tools for this. You can navigate to the SNS topic and use the "Publish Message" feature to send a test message. Then, you can navigate to the subscribed SQS queue and use its "Send and receive messages" feature to poll for and view the exact message that arrived in the queue.
---
Question #: 555
When a Lambda function is triggered by SQS, the function's event object contains an array of records. What happens if the function code successfully processes half the records but then throws an error before the function completes?

A. The successfully processed messages are automatically deleted from the queue.
B. No messages are deleted, and the entire batch becomes visible again in the queue after the visibility timeout.
C. The entire batch is moved to the Dead-Letter Queue.
D. The Lambda service automatically splits the batch and retries the failed half.

Answer: B

Explanation: The interaction between the Lambda service and SQS is transactional at the batch level. The Lambda service does not delete any messages from the queue until your function handler exits successfully. If your function throws an error at any point, the entire batch of messages that it was given is considered to have failed processing. The whole batch will reappear in the queue after the visibility timeout.
---
Question #: 556
You need to fan-out a message to three different SQS queues. Two of the queues are Standard queues, and one is a FIFO queue. How should you configure this?

A. Create a single SNS Standard topic and subscribe all three queues to it.
B. Create a single SNS FIFO topic and subscribe all three queues to it.
C. This is not possible; you cannot mix queue types as subscribers to a single topic.
D. Create an SNS Standard topic for the two Standard queues and a separate SNS FIFO topic for the FIFO queue.

Answer: C

Explanation: There is a strict compatibility requirement. An SNS FIFO topic can only have SQS FIFO queues as subscribers. An SNS Standard topic can only have SQS Standard queues as subscribers. You cannot mix and match them on a single topic. Therefore, you would need two separate SNS topics to achieve this.
---
Question #: 557
What does the `concurrency` of a Lambda function refer to?

A. The number of CPU cores allocated to the function.
B. The number of simultaneous, in-flight executions of your function that are happening at any given moment.
C. The number of versions of your function that you can have.
D. The number of messages the function can process in a single batch.

Answer: B

Explanation: Concurrency is the number of requests that your function is serving at the same time. When your function is invoked, Lambda allocates an instance of it to process the event. If another event arrives while the first one is still being processed, Lambda allocates another instance. The number of these concurrent instances is the function's concurrency.
---
Question #: 558
You have a producer application writing to an SQS queue and a consumer application reading from it. The producer is much faster than the consumer, and the queue is growing very large. What is the best way to scale the system?

A. Increase the SQS queue size.
B. Add more consumer application instances, allowing them to process messages in parallel from the same queue.
C. Switch to an SNS topic instead of an SQS queue.
D. Decrease the message retention period of the queue.

Answer: B

Explanation: This is the primary scaling model for SQS. The queue itself is highly scalable. To increase processing throughput, you scale the consumers horizontally. By adding more instances of your consumer application, you increase the rate at which messages are pulled from the queue and processed, which will reduce the backlog.
---
Question #: 559
You send a message to an SQS Delay Queue with a configured delay of 60 seconds. You then immediately try to poll for the message. What will you receive?

A. The message, but it will be invisible.
B. An empty response.
C. An error message indicating the queue is delayed.
D. The message, as polling overrides the delay.

Answer: B

Explanation: The purpose of a delay queue is to postpone the visibility of a message. When you send the message, it is stored in the queue immediately, but it is not visible to any consumer until the 60-second delay has passed. Any poll requests made during that time will not see the message and will receive an empty response (assuming no other messages are in the queue).
---
Question #: 560
An SNS topic for critical alerts needs to notify an on-call engineer via SMS and also create a ticket in a third-party system via an HTTPS webhook. What is the correct setup?

A. Two SNS topics, one for SMS and one for HTTPS.
B. One SNS topic with two subscriptions: one of type "SMS" and one of type "HTTPS".
C. An SNS topic that triggers a Lambda function, which then sends the SMS and calls the webhook.
D. An SQS queue that fans out to SMS and HTTPS.

Answer: B

Explanation: This is a straightforward use of SNS's multi-protocol capabilities. You can create a single topic for the alert event. Then you add a subscription for the engineer's phone number with the SMS protocol, and another subscription for the ticketing system's endpoint with the HTTPS protocol. SNS will handle delivering the same message to both endpoints.
---
Question #: 561
A Lambda function processes S3 events. To prevent a faulty deployment from causing a recursive loop (e.g., the function writes to the same bucket, triggering itself), what is a recommended best practice?

A. Use separate S3 buckets for input and output, or use different prefixes and configure the event notification to only trigger on the input prefix.
B. Add a "sleep" command to the Lambda function.
C. Set the Lambda concurrency limit to 1.
D. Manually disable the S3 trigger before every deployment.

Answer: A

Explanation: The best way to prevent recursive invocations is to ensure that the action your Lambda function takes does not re-trigger the same event it is listening for. The simplest way to do this is to have the function write its output to a different bucket or to a different prefix (folder) within the same bucket, and make sure the S3 event trigger is configured to only watch the source location.
---
Question #: 562
When using an SQS FIFO queue, what is the role of the `ReceiveRequestAttemptId` parameter when polling for messages?

A. It is used to get a specific message by its ID.
B. It is used during long polling to identify the poll request.
C. It is used to enable batching of messages.
D. It is used to de-duplicate receive requests, ensuring that if you make a receive call and it times out, a retry with the same ID won't result in processing the same messages twice.

Answer: D

Explanation: This parameter is part of the exactly-once processing guarantee for FIFO queues. When you make a `ReceiveMessage` call, you can provide this ID. If the call succeeds, you can use the same ID for subsequent calls within the visibility timeout window to get the same messages again without them being considered a new delivery. This helps with consumer-side fault tolerance.
---
Question #: 563
What is the primary difference between Amazon SQS and Amazon MQ?

A. SQS is a proprietary AWS service, while MQ is a managed service for open-source message brokers like ActiveMQ and RabbitMQ.
B. SQS supports more protocols than MQ.
C. SQS is more expensive than MQ for all workloads.
D. SQS is for decoupling, while MQ is for streaming.

Answer: A

Explanation: This is the key distinction. SQS is a cloud-native, highly scalable message queue service that uses a proprietary AWS API. Amazon MQ is designed for customers who want to migrate existing applications that already use open-source message brokers. It provides a managed environment for these brokers, supporting standard protocols like JMS, AMQP, and MQTT, which SQS does not.
---
Question #: 564
You are configuring an SNS FIFO topic. What is a mandatory requirement for the message body?

A. It must be in JSON format.
B. It cannot contain any message attributes.
C. It must contain a Message Group ID.
D. It must be smaller than a message in a standard topic.

Answer: C

Explanation: Just like with SQS FIFO queues, messages published to an SNS FIFO topic must include a `MessageGroupId`. This is essential for the service to be able to maintain strict ordering for messages within the same logical group as they are fanned out to the subscribing SQS FIFO queues.
---
Question #: 565
A Lambda function is configured to process messages from an SQS queue. The function's concurrency limit has been set to 5. The SQS queue has 100 messages waiting. What is the maximum number of times the function can be executing simultaneously?

A. 1
B. 5
C. 10
D. 100

Answer: B

Explanation: The concurrency limit acts as a ceiling on the number of simultaneous executions for a function. Even though there are enough messages in the queue to trigger more invocations, the Lambda service will respect the configured limit and will not allow more than 5 instances of the function to be running at the same time for this event source.
---
Question #: 566
Which scenario describes a "competing consumer" pattern?

A. A single message is published to an SNS topic and delivered to three different Lambda functions.
B. A job is placed in an SQS queue, and one of ten available worker instances picks it up and processes it.
C. An event from S3 triggers a Step Function workflow.
D. A client makes a synchronous API call to a Lambda function via API Gateway.

Answer: B

Explanation: The competing consumer pattern involves multiple consumers all polling the same message queue. They "compete" to be the first to receive and process a message. SQS is the classic AWS service for implementing this pattern, which provides high scalability for processing tasks in parallel.
---
Question #: 567
A message is published to an SNS topic with a message attribute `"customer_type": "premium"`. The topic has two SQS queue subscribers. Subscriber A has a filter policy: `{ "customer_type": ["premium"] }`. Subscriber B has no filter policy. Which queues will receive the message?

A. Only Subscriber A's queue.
B. Only Subscriber B's queue.
C. Both queues will receive the message.
D. Neither queue will receive the message.

Answer: C

Explanation: A subscriber with a matching filter policy will receive the message. A subscriber with *no* filter policy will also receive the message. A filter policy is used to *opt-in* to a subset of messages; if no policy exists, the subscriber receives everything. Subscriber A's policy matches, so it gets the message. Subscriber B has no filter, so it also gets the message.

Question #: 568
What is an event source mapping in AWS Lambda?

A. The IAM policy that allows a service to invoke a function.
B. A resource that you create which reads events from a stream or queue (like Kinesis, DynamoDB, or SQS) and invokes a Lambda function.
C. The JSON structure of the event that triggers a function.
D. A setting that maps a function's output to another service.

Answer: B

Explanation: For poll-based services, you don't configure the trigger on the service itself (like you do with S3). Instead, you create an event source mapping in Lambda. This mapping contains the details of the stream or queue to poll and the function to invoke, and the Lambda service manages the polling process based on this configuration.
---
Question #: 569
When is it appropriate to use an SQS Dead-Letter Queue (DLQ)?

A. For every SQS queue, as a best practice.
B. Only for FIFO queues.
C. When you have messages that might fail processing and you want to isolate them for analysis without blocking the main queue.
D. When you want to permanently delete messages that fail processing.

Answer: C

Explanation: A DLQ is a critical tool for building resilient, asynchronous systems. Any message that cannot be successfully processed (a "poison pill") can block the rest of the queue if it is retried indefinitely. By configuring a DLQ, these failed messages are automatically moved aside, allowing the processing of valid messages to continue, while also preserving the failed messages for debugging.
---
Question #: 570
An application requires that users be notified via email when their report is ready, and a separate system must be notified via an HTTP POST request. Which service can handle both of these notifications from a single event?

A. SQS
B. SES
C. SNS
D. EventBridge

Answer: C

Explanation: Amazon SNS is the ideal service for multi-protocol fan-out. You can create one topic for the "report ready" event. Then, create an "Email" subscription for the user notifications and an "HTTPS" subscription for the other system's webhook. Publishing a single message to the topic will trigger both deliveries.
---
Question #: 571
A Lambda function, triggered by SQS, is designed to process messages in a batch. If the function fails, the entire batch is returned to the queue, but one specific message is causing the failure. How can you configure the Lambda trigger to help isolate the problematic message?

A. Set the `BatchSize` to 1.
B. Decrease the visibility timeout.
C. Enable `BisectBatchOnFunctionError`.
D. Configure a Lambda Destination for failures.

Answer: C

Explanation: The `BisectBatchOnFunctionError` setting is a feature for SQS and stream-based triggers. If a function processing a batch returns an error, instead of retrying the entire batch, the Lambda service will split the batch in half and retry each half separately. It will continue this process recursively, which quickly isolates the single bad message that is causing the failure.
---
Question #: 572
What is the primary benefit of a decoupled architecture?

A. It reduces the number of servers needed to run an application.
B. It increases the resilience and scalability of an application by reducing interdependencies between components.
C. It lowers the network latency between application components.
D. It simplifies the security configuration of the application.

Answer: B

Explanation: Decoupling is a core architectural principle for building robust systems in the cloud. By using services like SQS and SNS, you create a buffer between components. This allows one component to fail, slow down, or scale without causing a cascading failure in the components it communicates with.
---
Question #: 573
You need to send a single message to an SQS queue, but you want it to be processed by a consumer exactly 5 minutes from now. What is the easiest way to achieve this on a per-message basis?

A. Set the queue's Delay Seconds to 300.
B. When sending the message, set the `DelaySeconds` message timer attribute to 300.
C. Set the queue's Visibility Timeout to 300.
D. Send the message, and have the consumer sleep for 5 minutes before processing.

Answer: B

Explanation: While a Delay Queue (A) applies a delay to all messages, a message timer (`DelaySeconds`) allows you to apply a delay on a per-message basis. This gives you fine-grained control over when a specific message becomes visible in the queue, without affecting other messages.
---
Question #: 574
Which of the following services uses a "push" model to trigger a Lambda function? (Choose TWO)

A. Amazon SQS
B. Amazon S3
C. Amazon SNS
D. Amazon DynamoDB Streams
E. Amazon Kinesis Data Streams

Answer: B, C

Explanation: In a push model, the event source service actively invokes the Lambda function. S3 (B) and SNS (C) are classic examples of this. When an event occurs (e.g., an object is created), the service itself calls the Lambda `Invoke` API. SQS (A), DynamoDB Streams (D), and Kinesis (E) use a pull model, where the Lambda service polls the source for records.
---
Question #: 575
A developer is building a chat application. When a user sends a message in a chat room, all other users in that room must receive the message in the order it was sent. Which service combination is best for this?

A. An SNS Standard Topic, one for each chat room.
B. A single SQS Standard Queue for all chat rooms.
C. An SNS FIFO Topic (for the chat room) with SQS FIFO Queue subscriptions (for each user).
D. A Kinesis Data Stream with a partition key for each user.

Answer: C

Explanation: This requires both fan-out (sending to all users) and strict ordering. The combination of an SNS FIFO topic and SQS FIFO queue subscriptions is designed for this. You would use the chat room ID as the `MessageGroupId`. This ensures that all messages for that room are fanned out to all subscribers' queues in the exact order they were published.
---
Question #: 576
What happens to a message in an SQS Standard queue if it is not processed and deleted, and its retention period expires?

A. It is moved to the Dead-Letter Queue.
B. It is permanently deleted from the queue.
C. An alert is sent to CloudWatch.
D. The retention period is automatically extended.

Answer: B

Explanation: The message retention period is a hard limit. If a message sits in the queue for longer than this configured period (default 4 days, max 14 days), SQS will automatically and permanently delete it. This is different from a processing failure, which would involve the DLQ.
---
Question #: 577
What is an "event" in the context of an event-driven architecture?

A. A log entry in CloudWatch.
B. A change in state, or an update, like an item being placed in a shopping cart or a file being uploaded.
C. A scheduled task that runs at a specific time.
D. A synchronous API call.

Answer: B

Explanation: An event is a signal that something has happened in your system. It's not just a message; it's a notification of a state change. In event-driven architectures, services react to these events asynchronously, performing work without being tightly coupled to the source of the event.
---
Question #: 578
A Lambda function needs to process messages from an SQS queue. The function takes, on average, 2 minutes to process each message. The default SQS visibility timeout is 30 seconds. What is the likely outcome?

A. The function will successfully process the message.
B. The function will time out after 30 seconds.
C. The message will become visible again in the queue after 30 seconds and will be picked up by another consumer, leading to duplicate processing.
D. The message will be moved to the DLQ after 30 seconds.

Answer: C

Explanation: This is a common misconfiguration. If the processing time is longer than the visibility timeout, the function will still be working on the message when SQS makes it visible again. Another Lambda invoker (or another consumer) will then receive the same message and start processing it. To fix this, the visibility timeout should be set to be longer than the function's expected execution time.
---
Question #: 579
You need to send a single message that will be processed by one worker from a pool of workers. The processing must be completed within one hour. Which service should you use to hold the message?

A. SNS
B. SQS
C. Step Functions
D. ElastiCache

Answer: B

Explanation: This is the core use case for a message queue. SQS implements the competing consumer pattern, where a message is delivered to only one consumer from a pool of available consumers. This ensures the task is only performed once at any given time.
---
Question #: 580
A company has a central SNS topic for all system events. They want to create a new analytics service that only processes "order_created" events. The event messages have a message attribute called "eventType". How can the analytics service subscribe to only the relevant events?

A. The service must subscribe to all events and filter them in its own application code.
B. By creating an SNS subscription for the service with a filter policy of `{ "eventType": ["order_created"] }`.
C. By creating a separate SNS topic just for "order_created" events.
D. This is not possible with SNS.

Answer: B

Explanation: SNS subscription filter policies are the efficient and scalable way to handle this. The subscriber declares the criteria for the messages it wants to receive. SNS performs the filtering on the service side, so the subscriber's endpoint is never even invoked for messages that don't match its policy, saving compute time and cost.
---
Question #: 581
What is the default maximum concurrency for a Lambda function in a given region within an AWS account?

A. 100
B. 500
C. 1000
D. There is no limit.

Answer: C

Explanation: By default, AWS sets a safety limit of 1000 concurrent executions for all Lambda functions combined within a single region in your account. This is a soft limit and can be increased by submitting a request to AWS support. This pool of 1000 is shared by all the functions in that region.
---
Question #: 582
In an event-driven design, an S3 object creation event triggers a Lambda function. What is the invocation type?

A. Synchronous
B. Asynchronous
C. Request-Response
D. Stream-based

Answer: B

Explanation: When S3 detects an object creation, it invokes the configured Lambda function asynchronously. This means S3 does not wait for the function to complete. It simply triggers the function and moves on. This is the standard model for S3 event notifications.
---
Question #: 583
Which setting on an SQS queue defines how long a message will be kept in the queue if it is not deleted?

A. Visibility Timeout
B. Receive Message Wait Time
C. Message Retention Period
D. Delay Seconds

Answer: C

Explanation: The Message Retention Period determines the maximum lifespan of a message in the queue. You can configure this from 1 minute to 14 days. If a message is not consumed and deleted within this timeframe, SQS will automatically delete it.
---
Question #: 584
You need to trigger a workflow whenever a new file is uploaded to an S3 bucket. The workflow involves several sequential steps with conditional logic (e.g., if the file is a video, transcode it; if it's an image, create a thumbnail). Which service is best for orchestrating this workflow?

A. SQS
B. SNS
C. AWS Step Functions
D. A single, complex Lambda function.

Answer: C

Explanation: While a single Lambda function could handle this, it would be complex and hard to manage. AWS Step Functions is the superior choice for orchestrating multi-step, conditional workflows. You can visually define the flow of states (e.g., "Check File Type", "Transcode Video", "Create Thumbnail"), and Step Functions will manage the execution, state transitions, and error handling robustly.
---
Question #: 585
To implement a "fan-out" pattern where messages are delivered to multiple consumers, which service should you use as the entry point for the message?

A. SQS
B. SNS
C. Kinesis Data Streams
D. ElastiCache

Answer: B

Explanation: SNS (Simple Notification Service) is specifically designed for the fan-out pattern. You publish a message once to an SNS topic, and the service handles duplicating and delivering that message to all of its diverse subscribers (like SQS queues, Lambda functions, etc.).
---
Question #: 586
What is the purpose of a Lambda function's "execution role"?

A. An IAM user that is allowed to manually trigger the function.
B. An IAM role that the Lambda function assumes when it runs, granting it permissions to access other AWS services and resources.
C. A role that allows other AWS services to modify the Lambda function's code.
D. A role that defines the maximum concurrency for the function.

Answer: B

Explanation: A Lambda function often needs to interact with other AWS services (e.g., read from an S3 bucket, write to a DynamoDB table, delete a message from an SQS queue). The execution role is an IAM role that you attach to the function, and it contains the policies that grant the function the necessary permissions to make these API calls.
---
Question #: 587
A developer sends 10 messages to an SQS FIFO queue, all with the same Message Group ID. There are 3 consumers polling the queue. How will the messages be processed?

A. All 10 messages will be processed in parallel by the 3 consumers.
B. The messages will be delivered one at a time, in strict order. A consumer must process and delete a message before the next one is delivered.
C. Three messages will be delivered in parallel, one to each consumer.
D. The messages will be processed in a random order.

Answer: B

Explanation: The Message Group ID enforces strict in-order processing for all messages within that group. Even if you have multiple consumers, SQS will only deliver the first message. Only after that message is successfully processed and deleted will SQS deliver the second message (from that same group) to an available consumer, and so on.
---
Question #: 588
What is a key benefit of using AWS Lambda in an event-driven architecture?

A. It provides persistent storage for application state.
B. You do not need to manage any underlying servers; you just provide the code.
C. It guarantees that code will execute in less than 1 second.
D. It can only be triggered via an HTTP request.

Answer: B

Explanation: Lambda is a "serverless" compute service. This means you are responsible only for your code. AWS handles all the underlying infrastructure management, including provisioning servers, patching operating systems, scaling, and monitoring. This significantly reduces operational overhead.
---
Question #: 589
You have an SQS queue and an Auto Scaling group of EC2 instances processing messages. At night, the queue is empty, but the EC2 instances are still running, incurring costs. What is the most cost-effective way to manage this?

A. Create a scheduled scaling action to terminate the instances at night and restart them in the morning.
B. Create a CloudWatch alarm based on the SQS metric `ApproximateNumberOfMessagesVisible` and use it to scale the Auto Scaling group to zero instances when the queue is empty.
C. Manually terminate the instances every night.
D. Use a smaller instance type for the workers.

Answer: B

Explanation: This is a prime example of event-driven scaling. By monitoring the queue depth (`ApproximateNumberOfMessagesVisible`), you can create a scaling policy that adds workers when there is work to be done and, critically, removes all workers (scales in to a minimum of 0) when the queue is empty for a certain period. This ensures you only pay for compute when it's actually needed.
---
Question #: 590
Which of the following are characteristics of an Amazon SQS Standard Queue? (Choose TWO)

A. Guaranteed message ordering
B. At-least-once message delivery
C. Exactly-once processing
D. High throughput
E. Limited to 300 messages per second

Answer: B, D

Explanation: SQS Standard queues are designed for maximum throughput (D), offering a nearly unlimited number of transactions per second. They provide at-least-once delivery (B), meaning a message will be delivered one or more times, but never lost. They do not guarantee order (A) or provide exactly-once processing (C).
---
Question #: 591
An SNS topic delivers a message to a subscribed Lambda function. The function processes the message successfully and exits. What happens next?

A. The message is deleted from the SNS topic.
B. The Lambda function must explicitly delete the message from the topic.
C. Nothing; the message delivery is complete, and SNS does not retain the message after successful delivery.
D. The message is sent to a backup SQS queue.

Answer: C

Explanation: Unlike a queue, an SNS topic does not persist messages after they are delivered. Once SNS successfully pushes the message to all of its subscribers, its responsibility for that message is complete. There is no concept of "deleting" a message from a topic.
---
Question #: 592
A Lambda function needs to process items from a DynamoDB table as they are added or updated. What should be configured as the trigger for the function?

A. An S3 event notification.
B. An SNS topic subscription.
C. A DynamoDB Stream associated with the table.
D. A CloudWatch scheduled event.

Answer: C

Explanation: DynamoDB Streams capture a time-ordered sequence of item-level modifications (insert, update, delete) in a DynamoDB table. You can configure a Lambda function to be triggered by this stream, allowing you to build powerful, event-driven applications that react to changes in your data in near real-time.
---
Question #: 593
To improve the resilience of a decoupled application, an SQS queue is configured with a Dead-Letter Queue (DLQ). When is a message moved from the source queue to the DLQ?

A. When the consumer application explicitly sends it to the DLQ.
B. After the message has been received from the source queue more times than the configured `maxReceiveCount`.
C. When the message's retention period expires.
D. Immediately after the first time a consumer fails to process it.

Answer: B

Explanation: The `maxReceiveCount` is the threshold you set in the redrive policy. Every time a consumer receives a message but fails to delete it (causing it to reappear after the visibility timeout), SQS increments a receive counter for that message. Once that counter exceeds your `maxReceiveCount`, SQS automatically moves the message to the DLQ.
---
Question #: 594
What is the maximum visibility timeout you can set for a message in an SQS queue?

A. 5 minutes
B. 15 minutes
C. 1 hour
D. 12 hours

Answer: D

Explanation: The visibility timeout for an SQS message can be set to any value from 0 seconds to a maximum of 43,200 seconds, which is 12 hours. This allows for very long-running processing tasks.
---
Question #: 595
You have a "fan-out" architecture where an SNS topic delivers messages to 10 SQS queues. You want to ensure that all 10 queues receive every message, even if one of the queues is temporarily unavailable due to a misconfigured policy. What feature helps ensure this?

A. The robust, independent retry mechanism of SNS for each subscriber.
B. The use of FIFO topics and queues.
C. The SQS visibility timeout.
D. The SNS message retention period.

Answer: A

Explanation: SNS treats each subscription independently. If it successfully delivers a message to 9 subscribers but fails on the 10th (e.g., due to a permissions error), it does not affect the successful deliveries. SNS will then follow its extensive retry policy (with backoff) for the single failed subscriber to give it every opportunity to receive the message once it becomes available again.
---
Question #: 596
A Lambda function, triggered by API Gateway, needs to start a process that will take 20 minutes to complete. What is the best architectural approach?

A. Increase the Lambda timeout to 20 minutes.
B. Have the Lambda function send a job message to an SQS queue and return a "202 Accepted" response immediately. A separate, long-running process (e.g., another Lambda, ECS, or EC2) can then process the job from the queue.
C. Run the entire 20-minute process within the initial Lambda function and make the client wait.
D. Have the Lambda function invoke another Lambda function synchronously to do the work.

Answer: B

Explanation: The maximum timeout for a Lambda function is 15 minutes, so running the process directly is not possible. Furthermore, making an API client wait for 20 minutes is not a good user experience. The correct decoupled, asynchronous pattern is for the initial Lambda to simply accept the request, enqueue a job in SQS, and return an immediate success response to the client. The actual long-running work is then handled by a backend process.
---
Question #: 597
Which of the following is an example of a "serverless" decoupled architecture on AWS?

A. An EC2 instance publishing to SNS, which triggers another EC2 instance.
B. An S3 event triggering a Lambda function, which writes a message to an SQS queue.
C. An on-premises server sending messages to Amazon MQ.
D. An Application Load Balancer distributing traffic to an Auto Scaling group of EC2 instances.

Answer: B

Explanation: A serverless architecture is one where you do not manage any underlying server infrastructure. S3, Lambda, and SQS are all managed, serverless services. This combination allows you to build a powerful, event-driven workflow without provisioning or patching any servers. The other options all involve server-based components (EC2, on-premises servers, Amazon MQ broker instances).
---
Question #: 598
What is the primary benefit of using Amazon EventBridge over just using SNS for event-driven architectures?

A. EventBridge supports more subscriber types than SNS.
B. EventBridge allows for more advanced, content-based filtering of events and can route events from many different AWS and SaaS sources.
C. EventBridge is significantly cheaper than SNS for all use cases.
D. EventBridge guarantees the order of events, while SNS does not.

Answer: B

Explanation: While SNS is excellent for simple fan-out, EventBridge is a more powerful event bus service. It can ingest events from a vast array of built-in AWS service sources, custom applications, and third-party SaaS partners. Its key feature is the ability to create complex rules that filter events based on the content of the event payload itself, allowing for much more sophisticated routing logic than the attribute-based filtering of SNS.
---
Question #: 599
A company has defined a Recovery Time Objective (RTO) of 15 minutes. What does this metric signify?

A. The maximum amount of data, measured in time, that can be lost after a recovery from a disaster.
B. The time it takes to create a full backup of the system.
C. The maximum acceptable amount of time that the application can be offline after a disaster occurs.
D. The minimum time required before a disaster is expected to happen again.

Answer: C

Explanation: Recovery Time Objective (RTO) is a business metric that defines the target time within which a business process must be restored after a disaster or disruption to avoid unacceptable consequences associated with a break in business continuity. It is about how quickly you need to be back online.
---
Question #: 600
A financial services application has a Recovery Point Objective (RPO) of 1 second. Which disaster recovery strategy would be most appropriate to meet this requirement?

A. Backup and Restore with daily backups.
B. Pilot Light with hourly data synchronization.
C. Warm Standby with data replication every 15 minutes.
D. Multi-Site Active/Active with synchronous data replication.

Answer: D

Explanation: An RPO of 1 second means that no more than 1 second of data can be lost. This requires continuous, synchronous, or near-synchronous data replication, which is a hallmark of a Multi-Site (or Multi-Region) Active/Active or Hot Standby strategy. The other options would result in much higher data loss (a higher RPO).
---
Question #: 601
Which of the following describes the "Backup and Restore" disaster recovery strategy on AWS?

A. A scaled-down version of the application is always running in the DR region.
B. Core services like the database are always running in the DR region.
C. Data is regularly backed up to a DR region (e.g., via S3 or RDS snapshots), and the full infrastructure is provisioned from scratch only during a disaster.
D. A full-scale, active version of the application is running in the DR region.

Answer: C

Explanation: The Backup and Restore strategy is the most cost-effective but has the highest RTO. It involves regularly backing up your data to the disaster recovery region. In the event of a disaster, you would use this data along with infrastructure-as-code tools like CloudFormation to build and launch a new production environment in the DR region.
---
Question #: 602
In a "Pilot Light" disaster recovery scenario, which components are typically kept running in the DR region?

A. The entire application stack at full production scale.
B. Only the application's infrastructure defined in a CloudFormation template.
C. A small, core part of the infrastructure, such as the database and perhaps a single application server.
D. Only the DNS records in Amazon Route 53.

Answer: C

Explanation: The "Pilot Light" analogy refers to the pilot light in a gas furnace: it's always on, but it's small and uses minimal resources. In this DR strategy, you replicate your data and keep the core services (often the database) running in the DR region. The main application servers are typically turned off and are only "lit" (launched and scaled up) when a disaster occurs.
---
Question #: 603
A company wants to improve its RTO from 12 hours (current Backup and Restore strategy) to under 1 hour. They can tolerate up to 5 minutes of data loss (RPO). Which DR strategy is the most cost-effective choice to meet these new requirements?

A. Multi-Site Active/Active
B. Warm Standby
C. Backup and Restore with more frequent backups
D. A single-site deployment with Auto Scaling

Answer: B

Explanation: A Warm Standby strategy fits these requirements well. By keeping a scaled-down but fully functional version of the application running in the DR region, the time to recover (RTO) is significantly reduced because you only need to scale up the running resources, not provision them from scratch. This can easily be achieved in under an hour. More frequent backups (C) would improve the RPO but not the RTO. Multi-Site (A) would be overkill and more expensive.
---
Question #: 604
What is a primary benefit of using AWS CloudFormation for disaster recovery?

A. It automatically backs up all your data.
B. It provides a way to define your infrastructure as code, allowing you to quickly and reliably provision a consistent environment in a DR region.
C. It encrypts all traffic between your primary and DR regions.
D. It provides a low-latency DNS failover service.

Answer: B

Explanation: CloudFormation is a key enabler of DR strategies like Backup & Restore and Pilot Light. By codifying your infrastructure (VPC, subnets, security groups, EC2 instances, load balancers), you can use the same template to create a consistent, tested environment in your DR region much faster and with fewer errors than manual provisioning.
---
Question #: 605
An application is deployed in a single region. To improve its disaster recovery posture, the company is using S3 Cross-Region Replication to copy objects from a bucket in the primary region to a bucket in the DR region. What does this achieve?

A. It improves the Recovery Time Objective (RTO) for the S3 data.
B. It improves the Recovery Point Objective (RPO) for the S3 data.
C. It provides synchronous replication of the S3 data.
D. It creates a complete, bootable copy of the application in the DR region.

Answer: B

Explanation: S3 Cross-Region Replication is a data-level DR strategy. By automatically and asynchronously replicating new objects to a bucket in another region, you ensure that you have a recent copy of your data available. This directly improves your RPO, as the amount of potential data loss is limited to the replication lag (typically seconds or minutes). It does not, by itself, provision infrastructure, so it doesn't directly affect RTO.
---
Question #: 606
Which Amazon Route 53 routing policy is specifically designed for an active-passive failover configuration?

A. Simple Routing
B. Weighted Routing
C. Latency Routing
D. Failover Routing

Answer: D

Explanation: Failover routing is designed for disaster recovery. You configure a primary resource (e.g., the load balancer in your primary region) and a secondary resource (in your DR region). Route 53 monitors the health of the primary resource via health checks. If the primary becomes unhealthy, Route 53 automatically starts routing all traffic to the secondary resource.
---
Question #: 607
What does the term "Recovery Point Objective" (RPO) measure?

A. The percentage of the application that must be recovered.
B. The target time to fully recover the application.
C. The maximum acceptable amount of data loss, measured in time (e.g., 1 hour of data).
D. The number of geographic points required for recovery.

Answer: C

Explanation: RPO is all about data loss. It is a business-defined metric that dictates the maximum age of the files or data that must be recovered from backup storage for normal operations to resume. An RPO of 1 hour means the business can tolerate losing up to 1 hour of data in a disaster.
---
Question #: 608
Which of the following scenarios describes a "Warm Standby" DR strategy?

A. Data is backed up nightly to S3 in another region.
B. An RDS database is replicated to the DR region, and a CloudFormation template is ready to launch the application stack.
C. A scaled-down but fully functional copy of the production environment, including EC2 instances and a load balancer, is running in the DR region.
D. Two full-scale production environments are running in different regions, both actively serving traffic.

Answer: C

Explanation: A Warm Standby involves having a complete, but smaller, version of your production environment running in the DR region. This allows for a faster recovery than Pilot Light because the application servers are already on and just need to be scaled up. It's a trade-off, costing more than Pilot Light but providing a better RTO.
---
Question #: 609
You are using AWS Backup to create daily snapshots of your EBS volumes and RDS databases. The backups are being copied to a DR region. Which DR strategy does this practice primarily support?

A. Pilot Light
B. Warm Standby
C. Multi-Site Active/Active
D. Backup and Restore

Answer: D

Explanation: The act of creating backups and copying them to another region is the foundation of the Backup and Restore DR strategy. These backups (snapshots) would be the data source you would use to "restore" your application by launching new EBS volumes and RDS instances from them during a disaster recovery event.
---
Question #: 610
A company has a global application and wants to route users to the AWS region that provides the lowest network latency. What Route 53 routing policy should be used?

A. Failover Routing
B. Geolocation Routing
C. Latency Routing
D. Multivalue Answer Routing

Answer: C

Explanation: Latency routing helps improve your application's performance for a global audience. Route 53 uses a network of measurement servers to determine which AWS region will provide the lowest latency for a given user, and then routes their DNS query to the resource in that region.
---
Question #: 611
What is a key difference between RPO and RTO?

A. RPO is about data loss, while RTO is about downtime.
B. RPO is measured in hours, while RTO is measured in minutes.
C. RPO is a technical metric, while RTO is a business metric.
D. RPO applies to databases, while RTO applies to EC2 instances.

Answer: A

Explanation: This is the most critical distinction. Recovery Point Objective (RPO) is focused on the past: how much data can we afford to lose? Recovery Time Objective (RTO) is focused on the future: how quickly do we need to be back in business?
---
Question #: 612
To implement a Pilot Light strategy for an application that uses an RDS database, what is the most important component to have running continuously in the DR region?

A. The application's web servers.
B. The Auto Scaling group configuration.
C. A continuously replicated copy of the RDS database (e.g., a cross-region read replica).
D. The Elastic Load Balancer.

Answer: C

Explanation: In a Pilot Light strategy, the data is the most critical and time-consuming component to restore. By having a continuously updated replica of your database (like a cross-region read replica for RDS) already running in the DR region, you ensure your RPO is low and significantly speed up your recovery time, as the data is already in place.

Question #: 613
Which AWS service can you use to automate the failover of your DNS records in a disaster recovery scenario?

A. AWS CloudFormation
B. Elastic Load Balancing with health checks.
C. Amazon Route 53 with health checks.
D. AWS Auto Scaling.

Answer: C

Explanation: Amazon Route 53 health checks are the key to automated DNS failover. You can configure health checks to monitor your application's endpoints (e.g., the health check URL of a load balancer). If a health check fails, Route 53 can automatically update the DNS records (e.g., in a Failover routing policy) to redirect traffic away from the unhealthy endpoint.
---
Question #: 614
You are designing a disaster recovery plan for a stateless web application running on an Auto Scaling group of EC2 instances. Which of the following is the most important element to replicate to the DR region?

A. The running EC2 instances themselves.
B. The launch template or launch configuration and the custom AMI used by the Auto Scaling group.
C. The Elastic Load Balancer's configuration.
D. The Security Group rules.

Answer: B

Explanation: Since the application is stateless, the running instances are disposable cattle, not pets. The most important thing is the ability to recreate them. By ensuring you have a copy of the AMI (which contains your application code) and the launch template (which defines how to launch the instances) in your DR region, you can quickly spin up a new, identical fleet of servers during a disaster.
---
Question #: 615
A company has chosen a Warm Standby DR strategy. In their primary region, they run 10 large EC2 instances. What would their DR region likely contain?

A. An AMI and a CloudFormation template.
B. A continuously replicated database and 2 small EC2 instances running the application.
C. A continuously replicated database, but no EC2 instances.
D. 10 large EC2 instances, identical to the primary region.

Answer: B

Explanation: Warm Standby implies a scaled-down but functional environment. This means having the data ready (replicated database) and a small fleet of application servers running and ready to be scaled up. Option (D) would be a Hot Standby/Multi-Site strategy. Option (C) is a Pilot Light. Option (A) is Backup and Restore.
---
Question #: 616
Which of the following has the LOWEST Recovery Time Objective (RTO)?

A. Backup and Restore
B. Pilot Light
C. Warm Standby
D. Multi-Site Active/Active

Answer: D

Explanation: A Multi-Site Active/Active architecture has the lowest RTO (and RPO), often measured in seconds or even zero. Because a full-scale, live production environment is already running in the DR region and actively serving traffic, failover can be nearly instantaneous, often handled automatically by a global load balancer or DNS routing.
---
Question #: 617
You are creating a disaster recovery plan for an RDS for PostgreSQL database. You need to be able to fail over to another region. What feature of RDS should you use?

A. Multi-AZ deployment
B. Automated Snapshots
C. Cross-Region Read Replicas
D. Enhanced Monitoring

Answer: C

Explanation: Multi-AZ (A) is for high availability within a single region (it protects against an AZ failure). For cross-region disaster recovery, you should create a Cross-Region Read Replica. In the event of a disaster, you can promote this read replica to become a standalone, master database in the DR region.
---
Question #: 618
To implement a Backup and Restore DR strategy, you are taking daily EBS snapshots. Where should these snapshots be stored to be effective for disaster recovery?

A. In the same S3 bucket as the application code.
B. In the same Availability Zone as the original EBS volume.
C. They should be copied to the designated DR AWS Region.
D. In an AWS Snowball device.

Answer: C

Explanation: A disaster recovery plan must protect against the failure of an entire region. Therefore, backups and snapshots must be copied to your designated DR region. Storing them in the same AZ or even the same region as the source provides no protection if that entire region becomes unavailable.
---
Question #: 619
What is a key trade-off when choosing a disaster recovery strategy?

A. Performance vs. Security
B. Cost vs. RTO/RPO
C. Scalability vs. Elasticity
D. Availability vs. Durability

Answer: B

Explanation: There is a direct relationship between the cost of a DR solution and the recovery objectives it can achieve. A Backup and Restore strategy is very cheap but has a high RTO and RPO. A Multi-Site Active/Active strategy has a near-zero RTO and RPO but is the most expensive to implement and maintain. The choice of strategy is a business decision based on how critical the application is.
---
Question #: 620
Which of the following is an example of a synchronous replication mechanism?

A. S3 Cross-Region Replication
B. RDS Cross-Region Read Replicas
C. RDS Multi-AZ deployment
D. DynamoDB Global Tables

Answer: C

Explanation: The replication between the primary and standby instances in an RDS Multi-AZ configuration is synchronous. This means a database write is not considered complete until it has been committed on both the primary and the standby. This ensures zero data loss (RPO=0) in the event of a failover, but it only works within a single region due to latency constraints.
---
Question #: 621
A company uses Amazon Aurora Global Database for its tier-1 application. What DR benefit does this provide?

A. It allows for fast local reads with low latency in each region.
B. It provides a global, active-active database with an RPO of seconds and an RTO of less than a minute.
C. It automatically backs up the database to all AWS regions.
D. It encrypts all data in transit globally.

Answer: B

Explanation: Aurora Global Database is a high-end DR solution. It consists of a primary cluster in one region and up to five secondary, read-only replica clusters in other regions. It uses dedicated infrastructure for replication with typical lag under one second (low RPO). In a disaster, you can promote one of the secondary clusters to be the new primary in under a minute (low RTO).
---
Question #: 622
In a Pilot Light DR scenario, what is the process of "lighting the pilot"?

A. Restoring the database from a snapshot.
B. Updating the DNS records to point to the DR region.
C. Provisioning the entire infrastructure from a CloudFormation template.
D. Starting and scaling out the application server fleet (e.g., the Auto Scaling group) in the DR region.

Answer: D

Explanation: In the "pilot" state, the core data services are running but the main application servers are either off or running at a very minimal scale. The act of "lighting the pilot" during a disaster involves starting these application servers, scaling them out to handle the production load, and then performing the final cutover.
---
Question #: 623
Your disaster recovery plan involves restoring an RDS database from a snapshot in a DR region. What is a critical prerequisite for this action?

A. The RDS instance in the primary region must be stopped first.
B. The snapshot must have been copied to the DR region.
C. The DR region must have the same security group rules as the primary region.
D. You must have an RDS Read Replica in the DR region.

Answer: B

Explanation: RDS snapshots, like EBS snapshots, are regional resources. To be able to restore a database from a snapshot in your DR region, you must first have a copy of that snapshot in the DR region. This is a common step in a Backup and Restore DR plan, often automated with AWS Backup or custom scripts.
---
Question #: 624
Which AWS service is fundamental for achieving automated, infrastructure-level disaster recovery?

A. Amazon S3
B. AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)
C. AWS CloudFormation
D. Amazon EC2

Answer: C

Explanation: While all these services are important, CloudFormation is the key to automating the "recovery" part of DR. By defining your infrastructure as code, you eliminate the need for manual, error-prone steps during a high-stress disaster event. You can reliably and quickly stand up an entire application stack from a template.
---
Question #: 625
A company has a business-critical application with a very low RTO and RPO. The application is served to a global audience. Which DR strategy would be most appropriate?

A. A Multi-Region Active/Active deployment using Route 53 latency-based routing.
B. An Auto Scaling group deployed across multiple AZs in a single region.
C. A daily backup of the application to an S3 bucket.
D. A Warm Standby deployment in a nearby region.

Answer: A

Explanation: For a global, critical application with low RTO/RPO, a Multi-Region Active/Active strategy is the best fit. This provides the highest level of availability and resilience. Using Route 53 with latency-based routing ensures that users are directed to the nearest healthy region, providing both performance benefits and a seamless failover experience in the event of a regional outage.
---
Question #: 626
What is the primary difference between a "Warm Standby" and a "Hot Standby" (or Multi-Site Active/Active) DR strategy?

A. A Warm Standby is in a different region, while a Hot Standby is in a different AZ.
B. A Warm Standby runs a scaled-down version of the infrastructure, while a Hot Standby runs a full-scale version.
C. A Warm Standby uses asynchronous replication, while a Hot Standby uses synchronous replication.
D. There is no difference; the terms are interchangeable.

Answer: B

Explanation: The key difference is the scale of the resources running in the DR region. In a Warm Standby, the infrastructure is functional but running at a reduced capacity to save costs. It must be scaled up during a failover. In a Hot Standby / Active-Active setup, the DR region has a full-scale deployment that is already capable of handling the entire production load.
---
Question #: 627
You are using AWS Backup to manage your RDS snapshots. You have a backup plan that creates snapshots daily and copies them to a DR region. What does this simplify?

A. The process of scaling the RDS database.
B. The automation and management of creating and copying backups for disaster recovery.
C. The process of failing over the database.
D. The encryption of the database.

Answer: B

Explanation: AWS Backup is a centralized service designed to simplify the management of backups across various AWS services. You can create a backup plan that defines the frequency, retention, and lifecycle of your backups, including a rule to automatically copy the backups to another region for DR purposes. This automates what would otherwise be a manual or custom-scripted process.
---
Question #: 628
Your disaster recovery plan requires you to be able to recreate your EC2 instances in another region. You have already copied your custom AMIs to the DR region. What other critical configuration item for your instances must also be recreated in the DR region?

A. The instance's public IP address.
B. The Availability Zone name.
C. The Security Groups and their rules.
D. The instance's metadata.

Answer: C

Explanation: Security Groups are VPC-specific and regional resources. To launch instances in your DR region and have them communicate correctly and securely, you must recreate the necessary Security Groups and their associated firewall rules in the DR region's VPC. This is often automated using CloudFormation.
---
Question #: 629
What is a "Recovery Time Objective" (RTO)?

A. The point in time to which data must be recovered.
B. The objective time it takes to create a recovery plan.
C. The maximum tolerable duration of an outage.
D. The objective for recovering deleted files.

Answer: C

Explanation: RTO is a measure of time, specifically the maximum amount of time your business can tolerate an application being offline. An RTO of 2 hours means that from the moment a disaster strikes, you have 2 hours to get the application back up and running.
---
Question #: 630
Which disaster recovery strategy typically has the highest RTO and RPO?

A. Warm Standby
B. Pilot Light
C. Backup and Restore
D. Multi-Site Active/Active

Answer: C

Explanation: Backup and Restore is the slowest and least current of the DR strategies. The RTO is high because you have to provision all infrastructure from scratch. The RPO is high because it's determined by your backup frequency (e.g., if you back up nightly, your RPO is 24 hours).
---
Question #: 631
For a stateless web application, which two AWS features are most critical for building a highly available and fault-tolerant architecture WITHIN a single region? (Choose TWO)

A. Elastic Load Balancer across multiple Availability Zones.
B. Auto Scaling group across multiple Availability Zones.
C. S3 Cross-Region Replication.
D. AWS Direct Connect.
E. Amazon Route 53 Failover Routing.

Answer: A, B

Explanation: For high availability *within* a region, the standard pattern is to use an Auto Scaling group to manage a fleet of instances distributed across multiple AZs (B). An Elastic Load Balancer is then used to distribute traffic to these instances and to automatically route traffic away from any that become unhealthy (A). The other options are primarily for disaster recovery (C, E) or hybrid connectivity (D).
---
Question #: 632
You have an RDS for MySQL database with a Multi-AZ deployment. The primary AZ experiences a complete outage. What is the expected outcome?

A. The database will become unavailable until the primary AZ is restored.
B. You must manually promote the standby replica to become the new primary.
C. Amazon RDS will automatically fail over to the standby replica, typically within 1-2 minutes, by updating the DNS record for the database endpoint.
D. The standby replica will start serving read-only traffic.

Answer: C

Explanation: The key benefit of RDS Multi-AZ is automatic failover. When RDS detects a problem with the primary instance or its AZ, it automatically promotes the synchronous standby replica in the other AZ to be the new primary. It does this by changing the CNAME DNS record of your database endpoint to point to the IP of the standby. This process is fully managed and usually completes in a minute or two.
---
Question #: 633
Which of the following would improve your Recovery Point Objective (RPO)?

A. Using CloudFormation to define your infrastructure.
B. Increasing the number of instances in your Auto Scaling group.
C. Switching from nightly backups to hourly backups.
D. Choosing a larger instance type for your application servers.

Answer: C

Explanation: RPO is about minimizing data loss. The most direct way to improve (lower) your RPO is to increase the frequency of your data replication or backups. Moving from nightly to hourly backups reduces your maximum potential data loss from 24 hours to 1 hour.
---
Question #: 634
A company is using the Pilot Light strategy. Their primary region fails. What is the first major step in their failover process after the initial decision to fail over is made?

A. Restore the database from the most recent snapshot.
B. Update the Route 53 DNS records to point to the DR region.
C. Launch and scale out the application servers using their pre-configured AMIs and launch templates.
D. Create a new VPC and subnets in the DR region.

Answer: C

Explanation: In a pilot light scenario, the data (database) is already running and being replicated. The infrastructure (VPC, etc.) is likely pre-provisioned. Therefore, the first *active* step in the recovery is to "turn on the lights" by starting the application servers and scaling them to handle the production load. DNS failover (B) would happen after the application servers are ready to accept traffic.
---
Question #: 635
What is the primary purpose of a DNS failover mechanism in a disaster recovery plan?

A. To back up the DNS records.
B. To automatically redirect users from an unhealthy primary site to a healthy disaster recovery site.
C. To scale the number of application servers.
D. To replicate data between regions.

Answer: B

Explanation: DNS failover, typically managed with a service like Amazon Route 53, is the mechanism that controls where your users' traffic is sent. In a DR scenario, its purpose is to detect that the primary site is down (via health checks) and then update the DNS records to point all incoming user traffic to the IP address of the load balancer or server in your DR site.
---
Question #: 636
Which of the following DR strategies provides the lowest cost but the highest RTO?

A. Multi-Site Active/Active
B. Warm Standby
C. Pilot Light
D. Backup and Restore

Answer: D

Explanation: Backup and Restore has the lowest cost because no compute or database resources are running in the DR region until a disaster occurs. You are only paying for the storage of the backups. This low cost comes at the price of the highest RTO, as you have to provision and configure the entire environment from scratch during the recovery process.
---
Question #: 637
You are creating a disaster recovery plan for a DynamoDB table. You need to have a continuously updated, readable copy of the table in another region. What feature should you use?

A. DynamoDB On-Demand Backups
B. DynamoDB Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR)
C. DynamoDB Global Tables
D. DynamoDB Streams

Answer: C

Explanation: DynamoDB Global Tables provide a fully managed, multi-region, active-active database. When you create a global table, you specify the regions where you want the table to be available. DynamoDB then automatically replicates any writes in one region to the other regions, typically within a second. Each region has a readable and writable copy of the table.
---
Question #: 638
A company has a requirement that its application must have an RTO of zero. What does this imply for their architecture?

A. The application must use a Backup and Restore strategy.
B. The application must have an RPO of zero as well.
C. The application must be deployed in a fault-tolerant, active-active configuration where failover is instantaneous and automatic.
D. The application must be deployed on a single, extremely large EC2 instance.

Answer: C

Explanation: An RTO of zero means there can be no downtime. This is only achievable with a Hot Standby or Multi-Site Active/Active architecture. In such a setup, a fully capable, redundant system is already running and ready to handle traffic, so a failure of the primary system results in an immediate and often user-transparent failover.
---
Question #: 639
To improve the RTO of a Backup and Restore strategy, what is the most effective action?

A. Take backups more frequently.
B. Use a smaller instance type in the DR region.
C. Heavily automate the restoration process using infrastructure as code (e.g., CloudFormation) and scripts.
D. Use S3 Standard storage instead of S3 Glacier for backups.

Answer: C

Explanation: RTO is about how fast you can recover. The biggest bottleneck in a Backup and Restore strategy is the time it takes to provision and configure the new environment. By using CloudFormation to define your infrastructure and scripting the data restoration and application deployment, you can significantly reduce the recovery time by automating these manual, time-consuming steps.
---
Question #: 640
Which of the following is NOT a characteristic of the Pilot Light DR strategy?

A. Lower infrastructure cost compared to Warm Standby.
B. Faster recovery time (RTO) compared to Backup and Restore.
C. A full-scale version of the application is constantly running in the DR region.
D. Data is replicated to the DR region.

Answer: C

Explanation: The defining characteristic of Pilot Light is that the main application infrastructure (like the web/app server fleet) is NOT running at full scale. It is either turned off or exists as a very small "pilot" instance. A full-scale running version would be a Warm or Hot Standby strategy. All the other statements are true of the Pilot Light approach.
---
Question #: 641
You are designing a DR strategy for a large data warehouse running on Amazon Redshift. The RPO is 8 hours, and the RTO is 12 hours. What is a suitable approach?

A. Configure Redshift to be a Multi-AZ deployment.
B. Enable cross-region snapshots for the Redshift cluster, which are taken automatically and copied to the DR region.
C. Use DynamoDB Global Tables to replicate the data.
D. Deploy a second, active Redshift cluster in another region and keep it synchronized.

Answer: B

Explanation: Amazon Redshift supports automated, cross-region snapshots. This fits well with the higher RTO/RPO requirements of a data warehouse. You can configure it to take snapshots periodically (e.g., every 8 hours) and automatically copy them to your DR region. In a disaster, you would restore the latest snapshot to a new Redshift cluster in the DR region.
---
Question #: 642
A company is using Amazon S3 for storing critical documents. They need to ensure they can recover from the accidental deletion of an object. Which S3 feature provides this protection?

A. S3 Cross-Region Replication
B. S3 Versioning
C. S3 Storage Class Analysis
D. S3 Transfer Acceleration

Answer: B

Explanation: S3 Versioning is a key data protection feature. When enabled, it keeps a copy of every version of an object. If a user deletes an object, S3 simply adds a "delete marker" as the latest version but retains all the previous versions. This allows you to easily "undelete" the object by removing the delete marker or restoring a previous version.
---
Question #: 643
What is the relationship between Availability Zones and a regional disaster?

A. Deploying across multiple AZs protects an application from a regional disaster.
B. Availability Zones are isolated locations within an AWS Region. A regional disaster would likely affect all AZs in that region.
C. Availability Zones are located in different AWS regions.
D. A regional disaster will only affect one Availability Zone.

Answer: B

Explanation: A multi-AZ architecture provides high availability and protects against failures of a single data center (an AZ). However, a large-scale disaster like an earthquake or flood could potentially impact all the AZs within a single geographic region. To protect against a regional disaster, you need a multi-region DR strategy.
---
Question #: 644
Your DR strategy is Pilot Light. You have a cross-region read replica for your RDS database in the DR region. What is the first step you must perform on the database during a failover?

A. Create a new read replica from it.
B. Increase its instance size.
C. Promote the read replica to make it a standalone, writable master database.
D. Restore it from a snapshot.

Answer: C

Explanation: A read replica, by definition, can only handle read traffic. In a failover, you need a writable primary database. The process for this is to "promote" the read replica. This action breaks the replication link and converts the read replica into a full, standalone database instance that can accept write traffic.
---
Question #: 645
Which of the following strategies has an RPO that can be measured in minutes, and an RTO that can also be measured in minutes?

A. Backup and Restore
B. Warm Standby
C. Multi-Site Active/Active
D. Cold Standby

Answer: B

Explanation: A Warm Standby provides a good balance between cost and recovery time. Because a scaled-down but fully functional version of the environment is already running, the RTO is low (minutes) as it only requires scaling up. With continuous data replication (e.g., RDS read replicas or DynamoDB Global Tables), the RPO can also be very low (minutes or seconds).
---
Question #: 646
You are using a Route 53 Failover routing policy. What is the role of the health check?

A. To check the health of the Route 53 service itself.
B. To determine if the primary endpoint is healthy and whether to fail over to the secondary endpoint.
C. To verify that the DNS records are correct.
D. To check if the secondary endpoint is healthy before failing over.

Answer: B

Explanation: The health check is the trigger for the automatic failover. Route 53 continuously monitors the resource specified in the health check (e.g., a load balancer in the primary region). If the health check fails for a configured number of consecutive checks, Route 53 considers the primary endpoint to be down and automatically switches the DNS records to point to the secondary endpoint.
---
Question #: 647
To implement a Backup and Restore strategy, you use AWS Backup. Which of the following resources can be backed up using this service? (Choose TWO)

A. Amazon EC2 Instances (via EBS snapshots)
B. Security Groups
C. Amazon DynamoDB Tables
D. IAM Roles
E. VPC Route Tables

Answer: A, C

Explanation: AWS Backup is designed to centralize and automate data protection for stateful services. It supports a wide range of services, including EBS volumes (which are the core of an EC2 instance backup) (A), DynamoDB tables (C), RDS databases, EFS file systems, and more. It does not back up configuration resources like Security Groups or IAM roles; you would use a service like AWS Config or CloudFormation for that.
---
Question #: 648
A company's primary goal is to minimize costs for disaster recovery. They can tolerate up to 24 hours of downtime (RTO) and 24 hours of data loss (RPO). Which strategy is the most appropriate?

A. Pilot Light
B. Warm Standby
C. Multi-Site Active/Active
D. Backup and Restore with daily backups

Answer: D

Explanation: The high RTO (24 hours) and RPO (24 hours) requirements clearly indicate that the business impact of an outage is low and cost is the primary driver. The Backup and Restore strategy, combined with a daily backup schedule, perfectly aligns with these requirements and will be by far the least expensive option.
---
Question #: 649
When failing over a database using an RDS cross-region read replica, what happens to the original primary database in the failed region?

A. It is automatically terminated.
B. It is automatically demoted to a read replica.
C. It remains independent. If it recovers, you could have a split-brain scenario if you don't manage it carefully.
D. It becomes read-only.

Answer: C

Explanation: The promotion of a read replica is a one-way operation that creates a new, independent master database. It does not affect the original source database. If the original primary instance eventually recovers, it will be unaware of the failover. You must have a clear operational plan to handle this situation, which usually involves preventing any writes to the old primary and re-establishing it as a replica of the new primary.
---
Question #: 650
Which AWS service allows you to replicate your EC2 instance AMIs to another region for disaster recovery purposes?

A. AWS Auto Scaling
B. Amazon S3
C. Amazon EC2
D. AWS Systems Manager

Answer: C

Explanation: The functionality to copy an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) is built into the Amazon EC2 service itself. From the EC2 console or using the API, you can select an AMI in one region and initiate a copy operation to a destination region. This is a crucial step for DR strategies that involve re-launching instances.
---
Question #: 651
In a Warm Standby DR setup, how is the application typically scaled up to full capacity during a failover?

A. By manually launching new EC2 instances.
B. By changing the instance types to larger sizes (vertical scaling).
C. By updating the desired capacity of an Auto Scaling group that is managing the application servers.
D. By restoring a larger database from a snapshot.

Answer: C

Explanation: A key part of the Warm Standby strategy is having the infrastructure ready to scale quickly. This is typically achieved by having an Auto Scaling group running with a minimum/desired capacity of a small number (e.g., 1 or 2). During failover, the main action is to simply update the desired capacity of this ASG to the full production number, and Auto Scaling will automatically launch the required instances.
---
Question #: 652
Which of the following is NOT a recognized disaster recovery strategy on AWS?

A. Pilot Light
B. Warm Standby
C. Multi-Site Active/Active
D. Cold Fusion

Answer: D

Explanation: The four recognized and commonly referenced disaster recovery strategies on AWS are Backup and Restore, Pilot Light, Warm Standby, and Multi-Site (which can be Active/Passive or Active/Active). "Cold Fusion" is not a term used to describe a DR strategy in this context.
---
Question #: 653
Your DR plan relies on Route 53 to fail over DNS. What is a critical consideration for the Time-to-Live (TTL) value of your DNS records?

A. The TTL should be set to a very high value (e.g., 24 hours) to improve performance.
B. The TTL should be set to a low value (e.g., 60 seconds) to ensure that clients and resolvers see the updated record quickly after a failover.
C. The TTL value does not affect the failover speed.
D. The TTL should be equal to your RTO.

Answer: B

Explanation: The TTL tells DNS resolvers around the world how long they should cache a DNS record. For a DR setup, you want a low TTL. If the TTL is 24 hours, even after you update the record in Route 53, some users might continue to be sent to the old, failed site for up to 24 hours. A low TTL ensures that when you fail over, the change propagates quickly across the internet.
---
Question #: 654
What is the most cost-effective way to implement a Pilot Light strategy for your EC2 web servers?

A. Keep a full fleet of web servers running in the DR region but in a stopped state.
B. Keep a single, small EC2 instance running in the DR region to serve as a template, and use an Auto Scaling group with a desired capacity of 0 or 1.
C. Keep a full fleet of web servers running in the DR region.
D. Keep a copy of the web server's AMI in the DR region, but no running instances.

Answer: B

Explanation: The "pilot" itself is the small, running instance. This instance can be used for testing and to ensure the environment is ready. The Auto Scaling group is configured and ready, but with a desired capacity set very low. This minimizes costs while ensuring the ability to rapidly scale out when needed. Keeping instances in a stopped state (A) still incurs some cost for the EBS volumes. Option D is a Backup and Restore strategy, not a Pilot Light.
---
Question #: 655
A company uses DynamoDB for its main application database. What is the easiest way to maintain a copy of the table in a DR region for failover?

A. Take daily backups and copy them to the DR region.
B. Enable DynamoDB Streams and use a Lambda function to replicate writes to a table in the DR region.
C. Enable and configure DynamoDB Global Tables.
D. Manually export the table to S3 and import it in the DR region.

Answer: C

Explanation: DynamoDB Global Tables is the fully managed, built-in solution for multi-region, multi-master replication. When you enable it, DynamoDB handles the replication of data between your chosen regions automatically, providing a simple and effective solution for disaster recovery and global applications.
---
Question #: 656
Which disaster recovery strategy represents the middle ground in terms of cost and RTO/RPO between Pilot Light and Multi-Site Active/Active?

A. Backup and Restore
B. Hot Swap
C. Warm Standby
D. Cold Backup

Answer: C

Explanation: The four DR strategies represent a spectrum of cost and recovery time. From highest RTO/cost to lowest, the order is: Backup and Restore -> Pilot Light -> Warm Standby -> Multi-Site Active/Active. Warm Standby sits in the second-best position, offering a faster recovery than Pilot Light but at a lower cost than a full Multi-Site deployment.
---
Question #: 657
You are using a Route 53 Failover routing policy. The primary endpoint fails its health check. What happens to the DNS queries?

A. Route 53 returns a server failure error.
B. Route 53 stops responding to DNS queries for that record.
C. Route 53 returns the IP address of the secondary (failover) endpoint.
D. Route 53 returns the IP address of the unhealthy primary endpoint.

Answer: C

Explanation: This is the core function of the failover routing policy. When the health check associated with the primary record fails, Route 53 marks that record as unhealthy and immediately begins responding to all subsequent DNS queries with the value of the record designated as the secondary.
---
Question #: 658
An application is using an EFS file system. What is the AWS-native way to create a backup for disaster recovery in another region?

A. Use S3 Cross-Region Replication on the EFS data.
B. Use AWS Backup to create scheduled backups of the EFS file system and copy them to the DR region.
C. Mount the EFS file system on an EC2 instance and use `rsync` to copy the data to another EFS file system.
D. EFS cannot be backed up across regions.

Answer: B

Explanation: AWS Backup provides a fully managed, centralized way to back up EFS file systems. You can create a backup plan that includes a rule to copy the recovery points to another region, providing a simple and integrated solution for DR.
---
Question #: 659
Which of these is a valid reason to declare a disaster and initiate a failover?

A. A single EC2 instance in an Auto Scaling group has failed.
B. The application is experiencing slightly higher latency than normal.
C. An entire AWS Region has become unreachable or is experiencing a widespread service disruption.
D. A new version of the application code has a bug.

Answer: C

Explanation: Disaster recovery plans are for large-scale failures. The failure of a single instance (A) should be handled automatically by an Auto Scaling group (high availability). A bug (D) should be handled by a rollback deployment. Declaring a disaster and failing over to another region is a major business decision reserved for catastrophic events like the failure of an entire region.

Question #: 660
In a Pilot Light strategy, the infrastructure in the DR region is often provisioned but not running. Which service is key to this approach?

A. AWS Auto Scaling, with desired capacity set to 0.
B. Amazon S3 for storing backups.
C. Amazon Route 53 for DNS.
D. AWS CloudFormation for defining the infrastructure.

Answer: D

Explanation: While the other services are used, CloudFormation is what enables the "infrastructure is provisioned" part of the strategy. You can have a CloudFormation stack that defines all your EC2 instances, load balancers, and security groups, but the Auto Scaling group within that stack can have a desired count of 0. This means the configuration is ready, but you aren't paying for running instances.
---
Question #: 661
Which of the following would improve your Recovery Time Objective (RTO)?

A. Taking more frequent snapshots of your database.
B. Automating your infrastructure deployment in the DR region with CloudFormation.
C. Storing your backups in S3 Glacier instead of S3 Standard.
D. Using larger EBS volumes.

Answer: B

Explanation: RTO is about the speed of recovery. The most significant factor in reducing recovery time is automation. By using infrastructure as code (IaC) with a tool like CloudFormation, you can stand up your entire application stack in the DR region in minutes, a process that could take many hours or days to do manually. More frequent snapshots (A) improve RPO. Storing backups in Glacier (C) would dramatically increase your RTO.
---
Question #: 662
An application has an RTO of 8 hours and an RPO of 1 hour. What does this mean for the DR plan?

A. The application must be recovered within 1 hour, and no more than 8 hours of data can be lost.
B. The application must be recovered within 8 hours, and no more than 1 hour of data can be lost.
C. The application must have backups that are taken at least every 8 hours.
D. The application must be deployed in an active-active configuration.

Answer: B

Explanation: RTO (Recovery Time Objective) defines the maximum downtime, so the application must be recovered within 8 hours. RPO (Recovery Point Objective) defines the maximum data loss, so no more than 1 hour of data can be lost. This implies the need for a backup or replication strategy that runs at least once per hour.
---
Question #: 663
You are using a single EC2 instance to host a critical legacy application. You need a simple and effective disaster recovery strategy that provides a standby instance in another Availability Zone. What should you do?

A. Create an Auto Scaling group with a minimum size of 2 across two AZs.
B. Create an AMI from the instance, and have a script ready to launch a new instance from the AMI in the second AZ.
C. Create a standby instance in another AZ. In case of failure, re-associate an Elastic IP address from the failed instance to the standby instance.
D. Take daily snapshots of the instance's EBS volume.

Answer: C

Explanation: For a single, stateful instance, using an Elastic IP is a common and effective DR pattern for AZ-level failures. You have a "cold" or "warm" standby instance in another AZ. When the primary fails, a script or manual process can quickly remap the EIP to the standby instance, redirecting traffic without needing a DNS change.
---
Question #: 664
Which data replication method is typically required to achieve a near-zero Recovery Point Objective (RPO)?

A. Asynchronous replication
B. Snapshot-based replication
C. Synchronous replication
D. Manual replication

Answer: C

Explanation: Synchronous replication requires that a write operation is confirmed on both the primary and the replica site *before* the write is acknowledged as complete to the application. This ensures that the replica is always an exact copy of the primary, resulting in an RPO of zero (no data loss). This typically only works over short distances with low latency, such as within a single region's AZs.
---
Question #: 665
What is the role of an Amazon S3 bucket in a Backup and Restore DR strategy?

A. To host the running application.
B. To act as a secure, durable, and cost-effective repository for storing backups like EBS snapshots, RDS snapshots, and application data.
C. To serve as the DNS endpoint for the application.
D. To provide a live replica of the primary database.

Answer: B

Explanation: Amazon S3 is the ideal destination for storing backups. It is highly durable (99.999999999% durability), cost-effective, and integrates with many AWS services. In a Backup and Restore strategy, the S3 bucket in your DR region is the central location where you store the data you will use to rebuild your application.
---
Question #: 666
Which disaster recovery strategy would be most difficult to test?

A. Backup and Restore
B. Pilot Light
C. Warm Standby
D. Multi-Site Active/Active

Answer: A

Explanation: While all DR strategies require testing, Backup and Restore is often the most difficult because it involves the most steps from a "zero" state. You have to test the entire process of provisioning the infrastructure, restoring the data, configuring the application, and validating its functionality, which can be a complex and time-consuming procedure. The other strategies have infrastructure already running, simplifying the testing process.
---
Question #: 667
A company has a global user base and wants to provide low-latency access to static content like images and videos. They also want the content to remain available to users even if their primary S3 origin region is down. What service should they use?

A. An Application Load Balancer with targets in multiple regions.
B. S3 Cross-Region Replication alone.
C. Amazon CloudFront with the S3 bucket as an origin.
D. A single EC2 instance with a large EBS volume.

Answer: C

Explanation: Amazon CloudFront is a Content Delivery Network (CDN) that caches content at edge locations around the world, providing low-latency access to users. It also improves availability. If the S3 origin server is unavailable, CloudFront can continue to serve cached content from the edge locations for a period of time, shielding users from the origin outage.
---
Question #: 668
Your company's DR policy requires you to test your failover procedure every 6 months. Your strategy is a Pilot Light in a DR region. What does a successful test primarily involve?

A. Verifying that your data backups are completing successfully.
B. Temporarily failing over DNS to the DR region and verifying the application becomes fully operational by scaling up the infrastructure.
C. Checking the CPU utilization of the database in the DR region.
D. Ensuring your CloudFormation template is free of syntax errors.

Answer: B

Explanation: A DR test must validate the entire recovery process. For a Pilot Light, this means actually executing the failover: scaling up the application servers from the "pilot" state, performing any necessary data synchronization or script execution, and then switching traffic (e.g., via DNS) to the DR environment to confirm that it can handle the load and function correctly.
---
Question #: 669
When considering disaster recovery for a stateful application, what is the most critical component to replicate?

A. The application code
B. The server configuration
C. The data
D. The network ACLs

Answer: C

Explanation: For a stateful application, the data is the most valuable and often the hardest part to recover. While the code and configuration are important, they are typically static and can be easily redeployed from version control or an AMI. The dynamic, constantly changing application data must be continuously replicated or backed up to meet the Recovery Point Objective (RPO).
---
Question #: 670
Which of the following services has built-in, synchronous, cross-Availability Zone high availability that you can enable with a single click?

A. Amazon EC2
B. Amazon S3
C. Amazon RDS
D. Amazon EFS

Answer: C

Explanation: Amazon RDS provides a "Multi-AZ" deployment option. When you enable this checkbox, RDS automatically creates and manages a synchronous standby replica of your database in a different AZ within the same region. This provides a simple, managed solution for high availability and automatic failover.
---
Question #: 671
You have an RTO of 4 hours. Which of the following DR strategies is LEAST likely to meet this requirement?

A. Pilot Light
B. Warm Standby
C. Multi-Site Active/Active
D. Backup and Restore

Answer: D

Explanation: Backup and Restore involves provisioning an entire environment from scratch and then restoring data. This is a time-consuming process that often takes many hours, making it unsuitable for a low RTO of 4 hours. The other strategies all have resources pre-staged or running in the DR region, allowing for a much faster recovery.
---
Question #: 672
What is the role of an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) in a disaster recovery plan?

A. It provides a way to back up dynamic application data.
B. It acts as a template containing the operating system, application code, and configurations, allowing you to launch new, identical EC2 instances quickly.
C. It is used to store DNS records.
D. It provides a static IP address for your application.

Answer: B

Explanation: An AMI is a fundamental building block for DR on EC2. By creating a "golden AMI" that contains your fully patched OS and configured application, you can ensure that when you launch new instances in your DR region, they are consistent and ready to go, significantly reducing your recovery time.
---
Question #: 673
What is a key consideration when choosing a disaster recovery region?

A. It should be the region with the lowest cost for EC2 instances.
B. It should be geographically distant from your primary region to protect against regional disasters, but close enough to manage latency if needed.
C. It must be in the same country as the primary region.
D. It should be the newest AWS region available.

Answer: B

Explanation: The choice of a DR region is a balance. It needs to be far enough away from your primary region that a single large-scale event (like a hurricane or earthquake) is unlikely to affect both. However, you also need to consider data residency laws and the potential impact of network latency on your data replication strategy.
---
Question #: 674
Which DR strategy would you choose for a non-critical development server where cost is the absolute primary concern and an RTO of 24 hours is acceptable?

A. Pilot Light
B. Warm Standby
C. Multi-Site Active/Active
D. Backup and Restore

Answer: D

Explanation: For non-critical systems with very high, flexible RTO/RPO values, the cheapest option is always the best. Backup and Restore incurs minimal costs, as you are only paying for the storage of backups and not for any running compute resources in the DR region.
---
Question #: 675
How does Amazon S3's intrinsic design contribute to disaster recovery?

A. All S3 buckets are global and replicated to all regions automatically.
B. S3 Standard storage class automatically stores your data across a minimum of three Availability Zones within a region.
C. S3 automatically fails over your DNS to a backup bucket in another region.
D. S3 automatically creates snapshots of your objects.

Answer: B

Explanation: Amazon S3 is designed for extremely high durability (99.999999999%). It achieves this by redundantly storing your objects on multiple devices across at least three Availability Zones within the selected region. This makes S3 resilient to the failure of an entire AZ, which is a form of high availability and protects against many types of disasters within a region.
---
Question #: 676
In a Multi-Site Active/Active DR strategy, how is traffic typically distributed between the two active regions?

A. All traffic goes to the primary region, and the DR region is on standby.
B. Traffic is distributed based on factors like user latency or geographic location using a service like Route 53.
C. Traffic is split 50/50 between the two regions at all times.
D. The traffic distribution must be switched manually.

Answer: B

Explanation: In an active-active setup, you want to make intelligent use of both active sites. DNS services like Route 53 are used to route users to the best possible site for them. This is often done with latency-based routing (sends users to the fastest region) or geolocation routing (sends users to a specific region based on their country).
---
Question #: 677
Your company is using an on-premises data center and wants to use AWS as a disaster recovery site. They need to continuously replicate their VMware virtual machines to AWS. Which AWS service is designed for this purpose?

A. AWS Backup
B. AWS Migration Hub
C. AWS Elastic Disaster Recovery (DRS)
D. AWS Snowball

Answer: C

Explanation: AWS Elastic Disaster Recovery (formerly CloudEndure Disaster Recovery) is the purpose-built service for replicating workloads into AWS for DR. It continuously replicates block-level data from your source servers (on-premises or in another cloud) to a staging area in your AWS account. This allows for very low RPOs and fast recovery times.
---
Question #: 678
Which Route 53 health check option is best for monitoring the health of a website served by a load balancer?

A. Monitoring an endpoint (IP or domain name)
B. Monitoring a CloudWatch alarm
C. Monitoring the state of other health checks
D. Monitoring a TCP connection

Answer: A

Explanation: To check the health of a web application, the most reliable method is to monitor an endpoint. You can configure the health check to make an HTTP/S request to a specific URL (like your load balancer's DNS name) and verify the response code and, optionally, look for a string in the response body. This confirms the entire application stack is working.
---
Question #: 679
A company uses a single EC2 instance for a critical application. To improve availability, they want to be able to quickly recover from an instance failure. What is a simple, effective strategy for high availability within a single region?

A. Take daily EBS snapshots.
B. Place the EC2 instance in an Auto Scaling group with a minimum and desired capacity of 1.
C. Deploy the instance in a placement group.
D. Increase the instance size.

Answer: B

Explanation: An Auto Scaling group is a key tool for self-healing and high availability. By placing the instance in an ASG with a min/max/desired of 1, you are telling AWS to ensure that there is always one instance running. If the instance fails its EC2 health check, the Auto Scaling group will automatically terminate it and launch a new, identical one to replace it.
---
Question #: 680
Which disaster recovery strategy has the RTO and RPO characteristics that fall between Backup/Restore and Warm Standby?

A. Hot Swap
B. Multi-Site Active/Passive
C. Cold Backup
D. Pilot Light

Answer: D

Explanation: On the spectrum of DR strategies, Pilot Light is the next step up from Backup and Restore. It offers a better RTO because the core data services are already running, but it is less expensive and has a higher RTO than a Warm Standby, where the application servers are also running (at a smaller scale).
---
Question #: 681
To prepare for a disaster recovery test, you have copied your encrypted RDS snapshot to the DR region. The snapshot was encrypted with a customer-managed KMS key. What must you also do before you can restore the snapshot?

A. Ensure the KMS key from the primary region has been replicated to the DR region.
B. Share the snapshot with the IAM users in the DR region.
C. Nothing, the snapshot can be restored directly.
D. Re-encrypt the copied snapshot with a KMS key that is local to the DR region.

Answer: A

Explanation: KMS keys are regional. To use an encrypted resource (like a snapshot) in another region, you need access to the key that encrypted it. While you can't use the original key directly, the question implies a prerequisite. The prerequisite to *using* the shared snapshot is that the *key access* must also be shared. A better answer might be related to re-encryption. Let's re-evaluate. When you copy an encrypted snapshot, you MUST re-encrypt it with a key in the destination region.

Answer: D

Explanation: When you copy an encrypted RDS (or EBS) snapshot to another region, the copy process itself requires you to specify a KMS key in the destination region. The data is decrypted in the source region using the source key and then re-encrypted using the destination key as it's being copied. Therefore, the resulting snapshot in your DR region is already encrypted with a local key and ready to be restored.
---
Question #: 682
A company has a multi-tier application. The web tier is stateless, but the database tier is stateful. When designing a DR plan, which tier will primarily determine the Recovery Point Objective (RPO)?

A. The web tier
B. The database tier
C. The DNS configuration
D. The Elastic Load Balancer

Answer: B

Explanation: The RPO is all about data loss. In this architecture, the web servers are stateless and can be easily replaced. The database, however, contains all the critical, dynamic data. Therefore, the frequency and method of replicating the database's data to the DR site will be the deciding factor for the overall application's RPO.
---
Question #: 683
Which of the following would NOT be part of a comprehensive disaster recovery plan?

A. A plan for failing over to the DR site.
B. A plan for testing the failover procedure regularly.
C. A plan for failing back to the primary site once it is restored.
D. A plan to prevent any single EC2 instance from ever failing.

Answer: D

Explanation: A core principle of cloud architecture is to assume that failures will happen ("design for failure"). A DR plan is about how you recover from failures, not how you prevent them entirely. It is impossible to guarantee that a single component like an EC2 instance will never fail. Instead, you build systems (like Auto Scaling groups) that can automatically recover from such failures.
---
Question #: 684
You are using a Backup and Restore strategy. What is the most significant factor that contributes to your Recovery Time Objective (RTO)?

A. The size of your data backups.
B. The frequency of your backups.
C. The time it takes to provision and configure your application infrastructure.
D. The number of users your application has.

Answer: C

Explanation: While the time to restore data (A) is a factor, the largest part of the RTO for a Backup and Restore strategy is often the time it takes to build the environment itself: provisioning the VPC, subnets, security groups, load balancers, and EC2 instances before you can even begin restoring the data. This is why automating this process is so critical.
---
Question #: 685
For a DR plan, you need to ensure that a copy of your application's custom AMI is always available in your DR region. How can this be automated?

A. Use an S3 lifecycle policy.
B. Use an AWS Lambda function that is triggered whenever a new AMI is created in the primary region, which then runs an API call to copy that AMI to the DR region.
C. Use Route 53 to copy the AMI.
D. Manually copy the AMI after every application update.

Answer: B

Explanation: This is a great use case for event-driven automation. You can create an EventBridge (CloudWatch Events) rule that triggers on the `CreateImage` API call. This rule can then invoke a Lambda function. The function's code would extract the AMI ID from the event and then initiate the `ec2:CopyImage` API call to replicate it to your specified DR region.
---
Question #: 686
What is a key benefit of using a managed service like Amazon RDS with Multi-AZ over managing a replicated database yourself on EC2?

A. It is always less expensive.
B. It provides you with SSH access to the database server.
C. AWS manages the complex and error-prone tasks of replication, health monitoring, and automatic failover.
D. It allows you to use any database engine.

Answer: C

Explanation: The primary value of managed services like RDS is the reduction in operational overhead. Setting up, maintaining, and testing a replicated database with automatic failover is a complex task. RDS handles all of this for you, providing a robust, highly available database with minimal administrative effort.
---
Question #: 687
A company is designing a DR solution for an application that writes files to an EBS volume. The RPO is 15 minutes. How can this RPO be met for the EBS data?

A. Take daily EBS snapshots.
B. Use a tool or script that takes and copies EBS snapshots every 15 minutes.
C. Replicate the data at the application level to an instance in another region.
D. Use S3 Cross-Region Replication.

Answer: B

Explanation: To meet an RPO of 15 minutes for EBS, you need a data protection mechanism that runs at least that frequently. You can use AWS Backup, the EBS direct APIs, or other tools to create a scheduled job that takes an EBS snapshot and copies it to your DR region every 15 minutes. Daily snapshots (A) would result in a 24-hour RPO.
---
Question #: 688
Which DR strategy has the highest operational burden during a failover event?

A. Multi-Site Active/Active
B. Warm Standby
C. Pilot Light
D. Backup and Restore

Answer: D

Explanation: Backup and Restore requires the most manual steps (or the most complex automation) during a recovery. You have to execute the entire process of building the infrastructure and restoring the data, which is operationally more complex than simply scaling up an existing environment (Warm Standby) or having an automatic DNS failover (Multi-Site).
---
Question #: 689
You have an RTO of 1 hour. Your current DR plan is Backup and Restore, and your last test took 5 hours. What is the most critical area to focus on for improvement?

A. The data replication strategy.
B. The infrastructure provisioning and application deployment automation.
C. The DNS TTL value.
D. The choice of EC2 instance types.

Answer: B

Explanation: The biggest gap is between the required RTO (1 hour) and the actual recovery time (5 hours). The longest pole in the tent for a Backup and Restore strategy is almost always the time it takes to build the new environment. Focusing on automating this process with tools like CloudFormation and deployment scripts will provide the most significant reduction in recovery time.
---
Question #: 690
What is the primary purpose of regularly testing your disaster recovery plan?

A. To satisfy auditors.
B. To identify weaknesses, validate assumptions, and ensure that the plan works as expected.
C. To reduce the cost of the DR environment.
D. To practice shutting down the primary site.

Answer: B

Explanation: A DR plan that hasn't been tested is just a theory. Regular testing is critical to ensure that your automated processes work, your data can be restored successfully, your RTO and RPO targets can be met, and your staff is familiar with the procedures. It uncovers problems before a real disaster strikes.
---
Question #: 691
Which AWS service is NOT typically a core part of a multi-region disaster recovery failover strategy?

A. Amazon Route 53
B. AWS CloudFormation
C. AWS IAM
D. AWS Auto Scaling

Answer: C

Explanation: AWS IAM is a global service. Your users, groups, roles, and policies are not tied to a specific region. This means that you do not need to replicate or fail over your IAM resources during a regional disaster; they will be available globally. The other services are regional and are key components of a DR plan.
---
Question #: 692
A company is using S3 Cross-Region Replication. They have enabled versioning on both the source and destination buckets. If a delete marker is added to an object in the source bucket, what happens in the destination bucket?

A. The delete marker is replicated, effectively "deleting" the object in the destination.
B. The object in the destination bucket is permanently deleted.
C. Nothing happens in the destination bucket.
D. The replication process fails.

Answer: A

Explanation: By default, CRR does not replicate delete markers. However, you can enable a setting to replicate them. If this setting is enabled, when you delete an object in the source, the delete marker is replicated, which makes the object disappear from the destination bucket's "latest" view (though the previous version is still retained). This keeps the buckets in sync. Assuming a modern setup, this is the expected behavior.
---
Question #: 693
For a "Warm Standby" DR strategy, why is the environment in the DR region "scaled-down"?

A. To improve performance.
B. To make it easier to test.
C. To save costs by running fewer or smaller instances than the full production load requires.
D. To comply with software licensing restrictions.

Answer: C

Explanation: The primary motivation for running a scaled-down version of the environment is cost optimization. A Warm Standby provides a much faster RTO than a Pilot Light, but running a full-scale replica can be expensive. By keeping a smaller but fully functional version running, you balance the need for a fast recovery with the desire to keep DR costs down.
---
Question #: 694
Your DR strategy uses a failover CNAME record in Route 53 that points to your load balancer. What is a prerequisite for this configuration?

A. The load balancer must have a static IP address.
B. The CNAME record must have a very high TTL.
C. You cannot create a CNAME record for the zone apex (e.g., `example.com`).
D. The load balancer must be a Network Load Balancer.

Answer: C

Explanation: A CNAME (Canonical Name) record maps an alias name to a true or canonical domain name. A fundamental rule of DNS is that if you have a CNAME record for a hostname, you cannot have any other DNS records for that same hostname. Since the zone apex (the "naked" domain) must have certain records like SOA and NS records, you cannot create a CNAME for it. This is why you must use an "A" Alias record in Route 53 to point a zone apex to a load balancer.
---
Question #: 695
What does "failback" mean in the context of disaster recovery?

A. The process of failing a second time after a recovery.
B. The process of restoring service to the original, primary region after it has been repaired.
C. The process of backing up the DR site.
D. The process of failing over to a third region.

Answer: B

Explanation: Failback is the process of returning production traffic to the original primary site after it has been declared healthy and ready to resume operations. This is often a planned and carefully managed process to ensure a smooth transition back from the DR site.
---
Question #: 696
Which of the following data stores is a multi-region, multi-master database by default, making it ideal for active-active DR?

A. Amazon RDS for MySQL
B. Amazon Redshift
C. Amazon DynamoDB with Global Tables
D. Amazon ElastiCache for Redis

Answer: C

Explanation: DynamoDB with Global Tables is designed from the ground up to be a multi-region, active-active database. You can write to any regional replica, and the changes are automatically propagated to the other regions. This makes it a perfect fit for global applications requiring extremely low RTO and RPO.
---
Question #: 697
A key principle of disaster recovery planning is to avoid having a single point of failure. Which AWS concept is a direct implementation of this principle for high availability?

A. Using a single, large EC2 instance.
B. Storing all data on a single EBS volume.
C. Deploying resources across multiple Availability Zones.
D. Using a single IAM user with administrator access.

Answer: C

Explanation: An Availability Zone is a distinct, physically isolated data center. By designing your application to run across multiple AZs, you ensure that the failure of any single data center will not take down your entire application. This is the most fundamental way to avoid a single point of failure for infrastructure within an AWS region.
---
Question #: 698
Your DR plan is based on Pilot Light. Data is replicated, and the CloudFormation template is ready. What is the single most important factor that will determine your Recovery Time Objective (RTO)?

A. The RPO of your data replication.
B. The speed at which you can launch and bootstrap your application servers.
C. The TTL of your DNS records.
D. The number of users trying to access the application.

Answer: B

Explanation: In a Pilot Light scenario, the data is already present. The failover process is dominated by the time it takes to execute the "lighting the pilot" phase: launching the EC2 instances from the template, waiting for them to boot, running any bootstrap scripts, and having them become healthy and ready to serve traffic. The speed and reliability of this process is the main component of your RTO.
---
Question #: 699
An application requires a storage solution that can be mounted by hundreds of EC2 instances simultaneously and provides a hierarchical file system for shared access. Which storage service is the most appropriate?

A. Amazon EBS
B. Amazon EFS
C. Amazon S3
D. Amazon Instance Store

Answer: B

Explanation: Amazon EFS (Elastic File System) is a fully managed, scalable file storage service designed to be mounted by thousands of EC2 instances concurrently, making it ideal for shared file access. EBS volumes (A) are block storage that can typically only be attached to a single instance. S3 (C) is object storage and cannot be mounted as a file system without a file gateway. Instance Store (D) is ephemeral storage local to a single instance.
---
Question #: 700
A high-performance computing (HPC) workload requires an EBS volume with the highest possible IOPS and lowest latency for a critical database. Which EBS volume type should be used?

A. Provisioned IOPS SSD (io2 Block Express)
B. General Purpose SSD (gp3)
C. Throughput Optimized HDD (st1)
D. Cold HDD (sc1)

Answer: A

Explanation: The io2 Block Express volume type is the highest-performance EBS storage, designed for I/O-intensive, mission-critical applications. It offers the highest IOPS, throughput, and lowest latency of all EBS volume types. gp3 (B) offers a balance of price and performance, while st1 (C) and sc1 (D) are HDD-based and optimized for throughput and low cost, respectively, not high IOPS.
---
Question #: 701
You need to select an EC2 instance type optimized for a workload that involves large-scale data processing and requires high sequential read/write access to large datasets on local storage. Which instance family is the best choice?

A. T-family (e.g., t3.large)
B. C-family (e.g., c5.xlarge)
C. I-family (e.g., i3.xlarge)
D. G-family (e.g., g4dn.xlarge)

Answer: C

Explanation: The I-family of instances is storage-optimized. They are designed for workloads that require high, sequential read and write access to very large data sets on local storage. They provide high-performance, low-latency NVMe SSD instance storage, which is perfect for this use case. T-family (A) is for burstable workloads, C-family (B) is compute-optimized, and G-family (D) is for GPU workloads.
---
Question #: 702
An application is designed to upload and download millions of small files to and from an S3 bucket. What is a key performance consideration for this workload?

A. The S3 bucket's total storage size.
B. The AWS region the bucket is in.
C. S3 can handle a very high number of requests per second, but performance can be optimized by using multiple prefixes in the bucket.
D. The S3 storage class (Standard vs. Glacier).

Answer: C

Explanation: Amazon S3 automatically scales to handle a very high request rate. It partitions its performance based on object prefixes. By spreading your uploads and downloads across multiple distinct prefixes (which act like folders), you can leverage more parallel request processing capabilities, significantly increasing the overall request rate your application can achieve.
---
Question #: 703
You are using a gp3 EBS volume and need to increase its IOPS without changing the volume size. Is this possible, and what is the benefit of gp3 in this scenario?

A. No, IOPS are directly tied to the size of a gp3 volume.
B. Yes, gp3 allows you to provision IOPS and throughput independently of the storage size, providing more flexibility and cost savings.
C. Yes, but you must also increase the throughput proportionally.
D. No, only io2 volumes allow for independent IOPS provisioning.

Answer: B

Explanation: The primary advantage of the gp3 volume type is that it decouples performance from storage size. Unlike its predecessor gp2, you can increase the IOPS and throughput of a gp3 volume without having to increase the volume's size, which allows you to pay only for the performance you need without over-provisioning storage.

A. A VPC Peering connection.
B. An Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA).
C. A Placement Group with a "cluster" strategy.
D. An Internet Gateway.

Answer: C

Explanation: A cluster placement group is a logical grouping of instances within a single Availability Zone. It is designed to pack instances closely together on the underlying hardware to provide low-latency, high-throughput networking between them. This is ideal for tightly coupled high-performance computing (HPC) workloads.

Question #: 705
An application reads and writes to an Amazon EFS file system from a large fleet of EC2 instances. The workload involves many small, metadata-heavy file operations. The application is experiencing higher-than-expected latency. Which EFS performance mode should be used to optimize for this scenario?

A. General Purpose mode
B. Max I/O mode
C. Provisioned Throughput mode
D. Bursting Throughput mode

Answer: A

Explanation: EFS offers two performance modes. General Purpose mode is the default and is optimized for latency-sensitive use cases, such as content management systems, web serving, and development workflows, which typically involve many small file operations. Max I/O mode (B) is optimized for higher aggregate throughput and higher levels of parallel operations but has slightly higher latency for metadata operations.
---
Question #: 706
To improve the performance of large object uploads to S3, which strategy should be used?

A. Uploading the file in a single, large PUT operation.
B. Using S3 Transfer Acceleration.
C. Using Multipart Upload to break the large object into smaller parts and upload them in parallel.
D. Placing the object in the S3 One Zone-IA storage class.

Answer: C

Explanation: Multipart Upload is the recommended method for uploading large files (anything over 100 MB). It allows you to upload a single object as a set of parts. These parts can be uploaded independently and in parallel, which can significantly increase throughput by better utilizing your available network bandwidth. It also provides resiliency, as a failed part can be re-uploaded without restarting the entire object upload.
---
Question #: 707
What is an "EBS-optimized instance"?

A. An EC2 instance that can only use EBS volumes and not instance store.
B. An EC2 instance that provides a dedicated, optimized network connection between the instance and its EBS volumes.
C. An EC2 instance that automatically encrypts all attached EBS volumes.
D. An EC2 instance that uses a special, high-performance type of EBS volume.

Answer: B

Explanation: Standard EC2 instances share network bandwidth between regular network traffic and EBS I/O traffic. An EBS-optimized instance provides a dedicated, high-bandwidth connection exclusively for traffic to and from its EBS volumes. This minimizes contention and provides the best and most consistent performance for I/O-intensive workloads. Most modern instance types are EBS-optimized by default.
---
Question #: 708
A database running on an EC2 instance requires a minimum of 30,000 IOPS at all times. The database size is only 200 GiB. Which EBS configuration meets this requirement in the most cost-effective way?

A. A 10,000 GiB gp2 volume.
B. A 200 GiB gp3 volume with 30,000 IOPS provisioned.
C. A 200 GiB st1 volume.
D. A 200 GiB io2 volume with 30,000 IOPS provisioned.

Answer: D

Explanation: The gp3 volume type (B) allows provisioning IOPS, but it has a maximum of 16,000 IOPS, which is not enough. The io2 volume type is designed for high-performance workloads and can be provisioned with up to 64,000 IOPS per volume. Provisioning a 200 GiB io2 volume with the required 30,000 IOPS directly meets the requirement without over-provisioning storage. A gp2 volume (A) would need to be very large (and expensive) to achieve this IOPS level.
---
Question #: 709
Which EC2 purchasing option is most suitable for a short-term, stateless, high-performance computing job that is fault-tolerant and can be interrupted?

A. On-Demand Instances
B. Reserved Instances
C. Spot Instances
D. Dedicated Hosts

Answer: C

Explanation: Spot Instances allow you to bid on spare EC2 compute capacity at a significant discount compared to On-Demand prices. They are ideal for fault-tolerant, flexible workloads because AWS can reclaim the instance with a two-minute warning. For a batch HPC job that can be stopped and restarted, this provides the best price-performance ratio.
---
Question #: 710
An Amazon EFS file system is configured with Bursting Throughput mode. What determines its baseline throughput?

A. The number of EC2 instances connected to it.
B. The amount of data stored in the EFS Standard storage class.
C. A value that is manually configured by the user.
D. The AWS Region it is located in.

Answer: B

Explanation: In Bursting Throughput mode, the baseline performance of an EFS file system is directly proportional to its size. Specifically, you get 50 KiB/s of baseline throughput for every 1 GiB of data stored in the EFS Standard storage class. The file system accrues burst credits when it is idle, which it can then use to burst to higher throughput levels.
---
Question #: 711
An application needs to frequently read a 500 GB dataset from an S3 bucket for analysis. To optimize performance for repeated reads, what is a good strategy?

A. Store the dataset in the S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class.
B. Use a Placement Group for the EC2 instances reading the data.
C. Copy the data from S3 to a high-throughput EBS volume (like st1) or instance store on the EC2 instance before processing.
D. Increase the number of prefixes in the S3 bucket.

Answer: C

Explanation: While S3 has high throughput, reading data over the network is always slower than reading from local storage. For repeated analysis of the same dataset, the best performance will be achieved by first copying the data from S3 to a high-performance local storage option on the EC2 instance (like an st1 EBS volume for high sequential throughput, or a local NVMe instance store). The analysis can then run against the local copy, maximizing I/O performance.
---
Question #: 712
What is the primary characteristic of an EC2 "burstable performance" instance (T-family)?

A. It provides a baseline level of CPU performance and the ability to burst to a higher level for a limited time.
B. It has the highest network bandwidth of all instance types.
C. It is optimized for memory-intensive applications.
D. It provides a dedicated physical server.

Answer: A

Explanation: Burstable performance instances (like T2, T3, T4g) are designed for workloads that are typically idle or have low CPU usage but occasionally need to burst to full CPU power. They accrue "CPU credits" when they are idle, which they can then spend to burst above their baseline performance when the application needs it. This provides a very cost-effective option for many general-purpose workloads.
---
Question #: 713
An application running on EC2 requires a shared file system. The application needs the highest possible IOPS and lowest latency for its file operations. Which configuration should be chosen?

A. Amazon EFS in General Purpose performance mode.
B. Amazon EFS in Max I/O performance mode.
C. Amazon FSx for Lustre.
D. Amazon EBS Multi-Attach.

Answer: C

Explanation: Amazon FSx for Lustre is a high-performance file system designed for the fastest processing of workloads. It is ideal for HPC, machine learning, and media processing workloads that require a POSIX-compliant file system with extremely high throughput and sub-millisecond latencies. It generally offers higher performance than Amazon EFS for these types of parallel workloads.
---
Question #: 714
What is the purpose of S3 Transfer Acceleration?

A. To encrypt data in transit to S3.
B. To provide a static IP address for an S3 bucket.
C. To enable fast, easy, and secure transfers of files over long distances by using CloudFront's globally distributed edge locations.
D. To accelerate the processing of data once it is in S3.

Answer: C

Explanation: S3 Transfer Acceleration is designed to speed up large object uploads from geographically dispersed clients. Instead of uploading directly to the S3 bucket's regional endpoint, users upload to a nearby CloudFront edge location. The data then travels over the highly optimized AWS global network to the S3 bucket, which is often much faster and more reliable than traversing the public internet.
---
Question #: 715
You are launching a fleet of EC2 instances that need to communicate with each other in a full mesh network. You need to ensure that if one instance fails, it does not affect the others. Which placement group strategy is appropriate?

A. Cluster
B. Spread
C. Partition
D. None, placement groups are not suitable for this.

Answer: B

Explanation: A Spread placement group is designed for high availability. It places a small number of critical instances on distinct underlying hardware racks. This ensures that if a single piece of hardware fails (like a rack power supply or network switch), it will only impact a single instance in your group. This is ideal for applications like database masters or cluster managers.
---
Question #: 716
Which EBS volume type is designed as the lowest-cost option for large, sequential workloads like big data processing, data warehouses, and log processing?

A. General Purpose SSD (gp3)
B. Provisioned IOPS SSD (io2)
C. Throughput Optimized HDD (st1)
D. Cold HDD (sc1)

Answer: C

Explanation: Throughput Optimized HDD (st1) volumes are backed by hard disk drives and are designed to provide low-cost, high-throughput performance. They are ideal for large, sequential I/O operations, which is the access pattern for data warehousing and log processing. They are not suitable for workloads that require high random-access IOPS, like databases.
---
Question #: 717
An EC2 instance is launched with an instance store volume. What happens to the data on the instance store volume if the instance is stopped and then started again?

A. The data is persisted and will be available when the instance starts.
B. The data is moved to an EBS snapshot.
C. The data is permanently lost.
D. The data is encrypted by default.

Answer: C

Explanation: Instance store provides ephemeral, temporary block-level storage. The data on an instance store volume persists only for the life of that instance. If the instance is stopped, hibernated, or terminated, all data on its instance store volumes is erased. This is why it is only suitable for temporary data.
---
Question #: 718
To achieve the absolute maximum network performance for tightly coupled HPC applications on EC2, what feature should be used?

A. Enhanced Networking with the ENA driver.
B. An Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA).
C. A 100 Gbps network connection.
D. A cluster placement group.

Answer: B

Explanation: An Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA) is a network interface for EC2 instances that is purpose-built for HPC and machine learning applications. It provides lower and more consistent latency and higher throughput than traditional TCP transport by using the Scalable Reliable Datagram protocol and OS-bypass capabilities. It is a step above standard Enhanced Networking (A) and is often used in conjunction with cluster placement groups (D).
---
Question #: 719
What is a primary benefit of using Amazon S3 for storing large, infrequently accessed data archives instead of an EBS volume?

A. S3 provides lower latency access.
B. S3 offers virtually unlimited scalability and is significantly more cost-effective for archival storage.
C. S3 data can be mounted as a local file system.
D. S3 data is replicated across multiple regions by default.

Answer: B

Explanation: S3 is an object storage service designed for massive scale and durability at a very low cost. For archival data, you can use storage classes like S3 Glacier and Glacier Deep Archive, which have an extremely low cost per GB. An EBS volume of the same size would be far more expensive and is not designed for unlimited scalability.
---
Question #: 720
Which of the following is a characteristic of a Provisioned IOPS SSD (io2) EBS volume?

A. It is the lowest-cost EBS volume type.
B. Its performance is measured primarily in MB/s of throughput.
C. It is designed to deliver a consistent, provisioned number of IOPS with low latency.
D. Its IOPS performance scales linearly with its size.

Answer: C

Explanation: The key feature of io2 (and its predecessor io1) volumes is performance consistency. They are designed for I/O-intensive workloads, like transactional databases, that require a sustained and predictable level of IOPS. You provision the exact number of IOPS you need, and the service is designed to deliver that performance consistently.
---
Question #: 721
A media company needs a shared storage solution for its video editing workflow. Multiple Mac and Windows workstations need to access and modify the same video files simultaneously. The files need to be accessible from their on-premises network. Which service is the best fit?

A. Amazon EFS
B. Amazon S3
C. Amazon FSx for Windows File Server
D. Amazon EBS

Answer: C

Explanation: Amazon FSx for Windows File Server provides a fully managed, native Windows file system. It is ideal for this use case because it supports the SMB protocol, which is native to Windows and macOS, and it provides the features, performance, and compatibility of a Windows file server. It can also be accessed from on-premises environments. EFS (A) uses the NFS protocol, which is less native for Windows.
---
Question #: 722
To get the best possible networking performance on a supported EC2 instance, what must be enabled?

A. Detailed Monitoring
B. A placement group
C. An Elastic IP address
D. Enhanced Networking

Answer: D

Explanation: Enhanced Networking uses single root I/O virtualization (SR-IOV) to provide high-performance networking capabilities on supported instance types. It results in higher packets per second (PPS), lower inter-instance latency, and lower network jitter. It is enabled by using drivers like the Elastic Network Adapter (ENA).
---
Question #: 723
When considering S3 performance, what is a "prefix"?

A. The first part of an object key, delimited by a slash (e.g., `logs/`).
B. A special tag that increases an object's request rate.
C. The S3 bucket name.
D. The AWS region identifier.

Answer: A

Explanation: In S3, an object key is the full path to the object (e.g., `logs/2023/08/event.json`). A prefix is any string of characters from the beginning of the key up to a delimiter. For performance purposes, S3 partitions its index based on these prefixes. Spreading your objects across many different prefixes allows S3 to scale its request handling capabilities in parallel.
---
Question #: 724
An application requires a minimum of 5,000 IOPS from its 500 GiB EBS volume. Which configuration is valid and cost-effective?

A. A 500 GiB gp2 volume.
B. A 500 GiB gp3 volume with 5,000 IOPS provisioned.
C. A 500 GiB st1 volume.
D. A 1667 GiB gp2 volume.

Answer: B

Explanation: A gp2 volume's IOPS are calculated as 3 IOPS per GiB. A 500 GiB gp2 volume (A) would only provide 1,500 IOPS (3 * 500), which is not enough. To get 5,000 IOPS from gp2, you would need a 1667 GiB volume (D), which is not cost-effective as you are paying for storage you don't need. A gp3 volume (B) allows you to provision the required 5,000 IOPS directly on the 500 GiB volume, making it the most cost-effective choice.
---
Question #: 725
What is the primary difference between Amazon EFS and Amazon FSx for Lustre?

A. EFS is for Windows, and FSx for Lustre is for Linux.
B. EFS is a general-purpose, scalable file system, while FSx for Lustre is a high-performance file system optimized for HPC and compute-intensive workloads.
C. EFS is object storage, while FSx for Lustre is file storage.
D. EFS is less expensive than FSx for Lustre for all workloads.

Answer: B

Explanation: While both are file systems, they are optimized for different use cases. EFS is designed for a broad range of general-purpose workloads and scales its performance automatically. FSx for Lustre is a specialized, parallel file system that provides the highest levels of throughput and IOPS for demanding HPC, AI/ML, and media processing workloads.
---
Question #: 726
Which of the following instance types are optimized for compute-intensive workloads like high-performance web servers, scientific modeling, and batch processing?

A. R-family (Memory Optimized)
B. T-family (Burstable)
C. C-family (Compute Optimized)
D. I-family (Storage Optimized)

Answer: C

Explanation: The C-family of instances (e.g., c5, c6g) are designed to provide the best price-performance for compute-bound applications. They have a high ratio of CPU power to memory, making them ideal for workloads that require significant processing power.
---
Question #: 727
You are uploading a 20 GB file to S3 using a single PUT operation from an EC2 instance in the same region. The upload is slow. What is the most likely bottleneck?

A. The S3 service is being throttled.
B. The network throughput of the EC2 instance is limited.
C. The EBS volume on the EC2 instance is too slow.
D. You are not using Multipart Upload.

Answer: B

Explanation: While not using Multipart Upload (D) is inefficient, the actual bottleneck for a single stream is often the network bandwidth allocated to the EC2 instance itself. Different instance types have different levels of network performance. If you are on a small instance type, its maximum network throughput may be the limiting factor for your upload speed.
---
Question #: 728
A company needs to host a large relational database that requires 100,000 IOPS and 2,000 MB/s of throughput. They want to use a managed storage solution. What should they use?

A. An EC2 instance with a local instance store.
B. An Amazon EBS io2 Block Express volume.
C. An Amazon EFS file system in Max I/O mode.
D. An S3 bucket.

Answer: B

Explanation: These performance requirements (very high IOPS and throughput) are characteristic of a high-end transactional database. The io2 Block Express volume type is specifically designed to meet these needs, supporting up to 256,000 IOPS and 4,000 MB/s of throughput per volume.
---
Question #: 729
You have a fleet of instances in a cluster placement group. What is a key limitation of this configuration?

A. You cannot use Spot Instances in a cluster placement group.
B. You cannot launch new instances into the group if there is not enough available capacity on a single rack.
C. The network latency between instances will be high.
D. All instances in the group must be of the same size.

Answer: B

Explanation: A cluster placement group attempts to place all its instances on the same physical rack in a data center to minimize latency. The downside is that if that rack runs out of capacity for the instance type you need, your request to launch a new instance into the group will fail with an "insufficient capacity" error.
---
Question #: 730
What are the two Performance Modes available for Amazon EFS?

A. General Purpose and Provisioned IOPS
B. Standard and High Performance
C. General Purpose and Max I/O
D. Bursting and Provisioned

Answer: C

Explanation: Amazon EFS offers two performance modes to choose from when you create a file system: General Purpose (the default, optimized for latency) and Max I/O (optimized for aggregate throughput).
---
Question #: 731
An application needs to download a 10 GB file from S3 as quickly as possible to an EC2 instance. What can be done to maximize the download speed?

A. Enable S3 Transfer Acceleration on the bucket.
B. Use a ranged GET request to download multiple parts of the file in parallel.
C. Place the file in the S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class.
D. Launch the EC2 instance in a different region from the S3 bucket.

Answer: B

Explanation: Similar to how Multipart Upload speeds up uploads, you can speed up downloads by making concurrent, ranged GET requests. Your application can issue multiple GET requests simultaneously, each for a different byte range of the object. It can then reassemble these parts on the EC2 instance. This parallelization can dramatically increase download throughput.
---
Question #: 732
Which EC2 instance family is designed for memory-intensive applications like in-memory databases (e.g., SAP HANA), real-time big data analytics, and large-scale enterprise applications?

A. C-family (Compute Optimized)
B. I-family (Storage Optimized)
C. M-family (General Purpose)
D. R-family or X-family (Memory Optimized)

Answer: D

Explanation: The R-family and X-family of instances are memory-optimized. They are designed to provide the lowest cost per GiB of RAM and are engineered for workloads that need to process large datasets in memory.
---
Question #: 733
What is the primary use case for an HDD-based EBS volume like st1 or sc1?

A. A boot volume for an EC2 instance.
B. A transactional database requiring high random IOPS.
C. Large-scale, sequential I/O workloads like data warehousing or log processing.
D. A shared file system for multiple EC2 instances.

Answer: C

Explanation: Hard Disk Drive (HDD) based volumes excel at providing high throughput for large, sequential read and write operations at a low cost. They are not well-suited for the small, random I/O patterns of a boot volume or a transactional database, which require the low latency of an SSD.
---
Question #: 734
You are designing a video-on-demand platform. The source video files are stored in an S3 bucket. How can you deliver this content to a global audience with low latency?

A. By using S3 Cross-Region Replication to copy the videos to all regions.
B. By using Amazon CloudFront with the S3 bucket as the origin.
C. By enabling S3 Transfer Acceleration on the bucket.
D. By hosting the files on an EFS file system instead.

Answer: B

Explanation: Amazon CloudFront is a Content Delivery Network (CDN). It caches copies of your content (like video files) in edge locations around the world. When a user requests a video, it is served from the edge location closest to them, which significantly reduces latency and improves the viewing experience. This is the standard architecture for delivering static/media content globally.
---
Question #: 735
An EBS volume is created from a snapshot. What is the performance characteristic of the volume immediately after creation?

A. It will have the maximum possible performance immediately.
B. The volume will experience higher latency for blocks that are being accessed for the first time as they are lazily loaded from S3.
C. The performance will be limited until the entire volume is read at least once.
D. The volume cannot be used until all data is restored from the snapshot.

Answer: B

Explanation: When you create a volume from a snapshot, the data is lazily loaded from S3 in the background. The volume is available for use immediately, but if your application accesses a block of data that hasn't been restored from S3 yet, it will experience a higher first-read latency. To avoid this, you can "pre-warm" the volume by reading all of its blocks, or use the Fast Snapshot Restore feature.
---
Question #: 736
What is the key benefit of using Amazon FSx for Lustre for a high-performance computing workload?

A. It provides a fully managed, low-cost NFS file system.
B. It provides a high-performance, parallel file system that can be tightly integrated with S3 for long-term storage.
C. It is designed for Windows-based applications.
D. It automatically encrypts all data in transit.

Answer: B

Explanation: FSx for Lustre is a specialized service that provides a file system optimized for high-performance, parallel I/O. A key feature is its seamless integration with Amazon S3. You can link your file system to an S3 bucket, allowing you to easily move your input data from S3 to the high-performance file system for processing, and then write the results back to S3 for durable, long-term storage.
---
Question #: 737
An EC2 instance needs to be able to sustain 10 Gbps of network bandwidth. Which of the following is a prerequisite?

A. The instance must be an EBS-optimized instance.
B. The instance must be launched within a VPC.
C. The instance must have Enhanced Networking enabled.
D. All of the above are required.

Answer: D

Explanation: To achieve high network performance like 10 Gbps, several conditions must be met. The instance must be launched in a VPC (all modern instances are). The instance type itself must support that level of performance. It must have Enhanced Networking (using the ENA driver) enabled. And for consistent high I/O to storage, being EBS-optimized is also a critical part of the overall performance picture.
---
Question #: 738
You have an EFS file system and you need to increase its throughput beyond what the Bursting Throughput mode can provide. What should you do?

A. Add more data to the file system.
B. Switch the file system to "Provisioned Throughput" mode and specify the desired throughput level.
C. Attach the file system to more EC2 instances.
D. Recreate the file system in a different Availability Zone.

Answer: B

Explanation: For workloads that require higher throughput than what is provided by the amount of data stored, you can switch to Provisioned Throughput mode. In this mode, you pay for and receive a consistent, specified level of throughput (in MiB/s) for your file system, regardless of its size.
---
Question #: 739
A workload requires a large number of EC2 instances to be launched in a single Availability Zone with the guarantee of minimal network latency between them. Which type of placement group should be used?

A. Spread
B. Partition
C. Cluster
D. Host

Answer: C

Explanation: A Cluster placement group is specifically designed for this purpose. It instructs AWS to place the instances as physically close together as possible on the same underlying hardware rack. This minimizes the network path between instances, resulting in the lowest possible inter-instance latency, which is critical for tightly coupled HPC applications.
---
Question #: 740
Which storage option provides the lowest latency access for an application running on an EC2 instance?

A. Amazon S3
B. An EBS gp3 volume
C. An EFS file system
D. A local NVMe SSD Instance Store

Answer: D

Explanation: The instance store consists of SSDs that are physically attached to the host computer that your EC2 instance is running on. Because the storage is directly attached, it bypasses the network and provides the absolute lowest latency and highest I/O performance possible. The trade-off is that this storage is ephemeral (non-persistent).
---
Question #: 741
When using a General Purpose SSD (gp3) EBS volume, what is the baseline IOPS performance that is included with the storage?

A. 1,000 IOPS
B. 3,000 IOPS
C. 5,000 IOPS
D. There is no baseline; all IOPS must be provisioned.

Answer: B

Explanation: A key feature of the gp3 volume type is that it includes a baseline performance of 3,000 IOPS and 125 MB/s of throughput, regardless of the volume's size. You can then provision additional IOPS (up to 16,000) and throughput (up to 1,000 MB/s) for an additional cost if your application requires it.
---
Question #: 742
A company needs to run a compute-intensive simulation that will take several hours. The simulation can be stopped and restarted without losing significant progress. To minimize costs, which EC2 purchasing model is most appropriate?

A. On-Demand
B. Reserved Instances
C. Spot Instances
D. Dedicated Hosts

Answer: C

Explanation: Spot Instances are ideal for workloads that are fault-tolerant and have flexible start and end times. Since the simulation can be interrupted and restarted, using Spot Instances will allow the company to run the compute job at a fraction of the On-Demand cost by leveraging AWS's spare capacity.
---
Question #: 743
What is the primary benefit of using an Amazon S3 VPC Gateway Endpoint?

A. It encrypts all S3 traffic.
B. It allows resources in your VPC to access S3 using private IP addresses without traversing the public internet.
C. It accelerates S3 uploads and downloads.
D. It allows you to mount an S3 bucket as a file system.

Answer: B

Explanation: A VPC Gateway Endpoint for S3 creates a private and secure connection between your VPC and the S3 service. It adds an entry to your route table that directs S3-bound traffic to the endpoint instead of an Internet Gateway. This enhances security by keeping traffic within the AWS network and can reduce data transfer costs.
---
Question #: 744
A company wants to place a group of EC2 instances in a way that reduces the risk of simultaneous failures. The instances are part of a critical application and should not share the same physical hardware rack. Which placement group strategy is suitable?

A. Cluster
B. Spread
C. Partition
D. None, this is not possible.

Answer: B

Explanation: A Spread placement group is designed for high availability of a small number of critical instances. It ensures that each instance is placed on a distinct hardware rack, each with its own network and power source. This minimizes the chance that a single hardware failure will take down more than one of your instances.
---
Question #: 745
Which EBS volume type offers the highest durability and is recommended for mission-critical applications like large relational databases?

A. General Purpose SSD (gp3)
B. Provisioned IOPS SSD (io2)
C. Throughput Optimized HDD (st1)
D. Cold HDD (sc1)

Answer: B

Explanation: Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1 and io2) volumes are designed with higher durability than General Purpose volumes. The io2 volume type, in particular, is designed for 99.999% durability (compared to 99.8% - 99.9% for gp3), making it the recommended choice for critical applications where data loss cannot be tolerated.
---
Question #: 746
You are designing an application that will be deployed on EC2 instances. The application requires a file system that can be accessed by both Linux and Windows instances simultaneously. Which AWS storage service should you use?

A. Amazon EFS
B. Amazon FSx for Windows File Server
C. Amazon FSx for Lustre
D. This is not possible.

Answer: B

Explanation: While EFS (A) is for Linux (using NFS) and FSx for Lustre (C) is a high-performance file system, Amazon FSx for Windows File Server uses the SMB protocol. The SMB protocol is natively supported by both Windows and modern Linux distributions (via clients like `cifs-utils`), making it the best choice for a shared file system that needs to be accessed by both operating systems.
---
Question #: 747
An application is performing a large number of small, random read and write operations on a storage volume. Which performance metric is most important for this workload?

A. Throughput (MB/s)
B. IOPS (Input/Output Operations Per Second)
C. Network Bandwidth (Gbps)
D. Durability (%)

Answer: B

Explanation: IOPS measures the number of read and write operations a storage device can perform per second. For workloads with many small, random I/O requests (like a transactional database), a high IOPS capability is the most critical performance indicator. Throughput (A) is more important for large, sequential file transfers.
---
Question #: 748
To achieve the highest possible throughput for a big data analytics job, you are using a fleet of I-family (storage optimized) EC2 instances. How can you aggregate the local NVMe instance stores of these instances into a single, high-performance file system?

A. This is not possible; instance stores cannot be combined.
B. By creating a RAID 0 array across the instance store volumes on a single instance.
C. By using a parallel file system like BeeGFS or Lustre, or a service like Amazon FSx for Lustre, which can be backed by the instances' local storage.
D. By using an EBS Multi-Attach volume.

Answer: C

Explanation: The NVMe drives in storage-optimized instances provide excellent performance. For a distributed job, you can use software to create a parallel file system that spans across the local disks of multiple instances. Services like FSx for Lustre can be configured to use S3 as a durable backend but present a high-performance file system to the compute fleet.

Question #: 749
You have an EFS file system that stores 100 GiB of data and is configured for Bursting Throughput. What is its baseline throughput?

A. 100 MiB/s
B. 50 MiB/s
C. 5 MiB/s
D. 1 MiB/s

Answer: C

Explanation: In Bursting Throughput mode, EFS provides a baseline throughput of 50 KiB/s per 1 GiB of data stored in the Standard storage class. Therefore, for 100 GiB of data, the baseline throughput would be 100 * 50 KiB/s = 5,000 KiB/s, which is approximately 5 MiB/s.

Question #: 750
What is the primary benefit of using an EC2 instance from an ARM-based AWS Graviton processor family (e.g., c6g, m6g) compared to a similar x86-based instance?

A. They offer better price-performance for many workloads.
B. They are compatible with all legacy software without modification.
C. They provide access to on-board FPGAs.
D. They have a higher maximum memory capacity.

Answer: A

Explanation: AWS Graviton processors are custom-built by AWS using the ARM architecture. They are designed to deliver significant price-performance benefits (up to 40% better in some cases) for a wide variety of cloud-native and scale-out workloads compared to equivalent x86-based instances from previous generations.

Question #: 751
Which S3 feature can automatically move objects between storage classes based on access patterns to optimize costs?

A. S3 Versioning
B. S3 Lifecycle Policies with Intelligent-Tiering
C. S3 Cross-Region Replication
D. S3 Batch Operations

Answer: B

Explanation: The S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class is designed to automate cost savings. It works by monitoring the access patterns of your objects. If an object hasn't been accessed for a certain period (e.g., 30 days), Intelligent-Tiering will automatically move it to a lower-cost, infrequent access tier. If the object is accessed again, it is automatically moved back to the frequent access tier. S3 Lifecycle policies can also be used to transition objects, but Intelligent-Tiering is the automated, access-pattern-based solution.

Question #: 752
A company needs to launch a group of EC2 instances into a specific hardware rack that has unique features. They also need to ensure that no other AWS customer can run instances on that same physical server. Which EC2 tenancy option should they choose?

A. Default (shared) tenancy
B. Dedicated Instances
C. Dedicated Hosts
D. Spot Instances

Answer: C

Explanation: A Dedicated Host provides you with a physical server that is fully dedicated to your use. This is the highest level of isolation and is used for compliance requirements or software licenses that are tied to physical cores or sockets. You have visibility into the underlying hardware and can control instance placement. Dedicated Instances (B) run on dedicated hardware, but you don't have the same level of control over placement.
---
Question #: 753
What is the maximum amount of throughput you can provision for a single gp3 EBS volume?

A. 125 MB/s
B. 250 MB/s
C. 500 MB/s
D. 1,000 MB/s

Answer: D

Explanation: The gp3 volume type allows you to provision throughput independently of size. It includes a baseline of 125 MB/s, but you can provision additional throughput up to a maximum of 1,000 MB/s per volume.
---
Question #: 754
For which workload is an Amazon EFS file system a better choice than an Amazon EBS volume?

A. A boot volume for a single Windows EC2 instance.
B. A high-performance transactional database.
C. A shared content repository for a fleet of web servers running a content management system.
D. A volume requiring 100,000 IOPS.

Answer: C

Explanation: The key differentiator is the need for shared access. An EFS file system can be mounted and accessed by many EC2 instances simultaneously, making it perfect for use cases like a shared content repository, a home directory for multiple users, or a common data source for a cluster of application servers. EBS volumes are primarily for single-instance access.
---
Question #: 755
An application is experiencing high latency when reading data from an EBS volume. The CloudWatch metrics show that the volume's `BurstBalance` is at zero and the `VolumeQueueLength` is high. What does this indicate?

A. The network connection to the instance is saturated.
B. The EC2 instance's CPU is overloaded.
C. The application is demanding more IOPS than the EBS volume can provide, and it has exhausted its burst credits.
D. The EBS volume is not attached to an EBS-optimized instance.

Answer: C

Explanation: `BurstBalance` is the metric for burstable volumes (like gp2) that shows the remaining I/O credits. A balance of zero means the volume has been operating above its baseline performance and has used up all its credits, so its performance is now being throttled. A high `VolumeQueueLength` indicates that I/O operations are being queued up because the volume cannot service them fast enough. This confirms an I/O bottleneck at the volume level.
---
Question #: 756
You need to launch a group of EC2 instances for a tightly coupled workload. To reduce the impact of simultaneous hardware failures, you want to distribute the instances across a small number of distinct hardware racks within a single Availability Zone. Which placement group strategy is best?

A. Cluster
B. Spread
C. Partition
D. This is not possible.

Answer: C

Explanation: A Partition placement group provides a balance between the low latency of a cluster group and the high availability of a spread group. It divides the instances into logical partitions, and each partition resides on a separate hardware rack. This is ideal for distributed, partition-aware applications like HDFS, HBase, and Cassandra, as it limits the blast radius of a hardware failure to a single partition.
---
Question #: 757
What is a key performance benefit of using an Application Load Balancer instead of a Classic Load Balancer?

A. It supports routing based on the content of the request, such as the URL path, which can direct traffic to optimized microservices.
B. It provides a static IP address for each Availability Zone.
C. It can handle non-HTTP protocols.
D. It has a lower cost for all traffic levels.

Answer: A

Explanation: A major advantage of the ALB is its ability to perform content-based routing at Layer 7. This allows you to have a single load balancer that serves multiple microservices. For example, requests to `/api` go to the API servers, and requests to `/images` go to the image processing servers. This simplifies the architecture and allows for more efficient resource utilization compared to the simple routing of a Classic Load Balancer.
---
Question #: 758
An application requires a storage volume that can provide a sustained 20,000 IOPS. The data size is 1 TB. Which EBS volume type should be selected?

A. General Purpose SSD (gp3)
B. Throughput Optimized HDD (st1)
C. Provisioned IOPS SSD (io2)
D. Cold HDD (sc1)

Answer: C

Explanation: The requirement for 20,000 sustained IOPS is beyond the maximum capability of a gp3 volume (16,000 IOPS). Therefore, a Provisioned IOPS SSD volume (io1 or io2) is required. An io2 volume can be provisioned with the necessary 20,000 IOPS to meet the application's performance demands consistently.
---
Question #: 759
You need to run a graphical workstation in the cloud for video rendering. The application requires a powerful GPU. Which EC2 instance family should you choose?

A. C-family (Compute Optimized)
B. R-family (Memory Optimized)
C. G-family or P-family (Accelerated Computing)
D. T-family (Burstable)

Answer: C

Explanation: The G-family and P-family of instances are part of the Accelerated Computing category. They are equipped with powerful NVIDIA GPUs and are designed for graphics-intensive applications like 3D visualizations and video rendering, as well as for machine learning and high-performance computing.
---
Question #: 760
When uploading a 50 GB file to S3, which practice is recommended to improve performance and reliability?

A. Use a single PUT operation for the entire file.
B. Compress the file before uploading.
C. Use Multipart Upload.
D. Use a Spot EC2 instance for the upload.

Answer: C

Explanation: For any file larger than 100 MB (and required for files > 5 GB), you should use Multipart Upload. This process breaks the file into smaller, independent parts that can be uploaded in parallel. This improves throughput by maximizing bandwidth usage and increases reliability because a failure of a single part only requires that part to be re-transmitted, not the entire file.
---
Question #: 761
An EFS file system is used by a web application to store user-uploaded images. The number of images is growing rapidly. How does the EFS file system scale to handle this growth?

A. You must manually provision a larger file system size.
B. EFS automatically grows and shrinks as you add and remove files, with no need for manual provisioning.
C. You must add more EFS mount targets.
D. You need to attach a larger EBS volume to the file system.

Answer: B

Explanation: A key feature of Amazon EFS is its elasticity. The file system storage capacity is fully elastic, meaning it scales up or down automatically as you add or remove files. You are billed only for the amount of storage you are actually using.
---
Question #: 762
An application requires the lowest possible latency for storage I/O. Data persistence is not a concern, as the data is temporary. Which storage option should be used?

A. EBS Provisioned IOPS SSD (io2)
B. EBS General Purpose SSD (gp3)
C. EFS in General Purpose mode
D. Local NVMe SSD Instance Store

Answer: D

Explanation: For the absolute lowest latency, nothing beats a local instance store. Because the SSDs are physically connected to the host server, the data does not have to traverse the network like it does for EBS or EFS. This provides microsecond-level latency, but with the trade-off that the data is ephemeral and will be lost if the instance is stopped or terminated.
---
Question #: 763
What is the primary factor that determines the network performance of an EC2 instance?

A. The AWS Region it is in.
B. The instance type and size.
C. The EBS volume type attached to it.
D. The number of security groups attached.

Answer: B

Explanation: Network performance (bandwidth, packets per second) is a characteristic of the EC2 instance type. In general, larger instances within a family have better network performance than smaller instances. AWS publishes network performance ratings like "Up to 5 Gbps" or "25 Gbps" for its various instance types.
---
Question #: 764
You are trying to attach a single EBS volume to two different EC2 instances at the same time. The operation fails. What is the most likely reason?

A. The instances are in different Availability Zones.
B. Standard EBS volumes do not support being attached to multiple instances simultaneously.
C. The EBS volume is not encrypted.
D. The EC2 instances are not part of a cluster placement group.

Answer: B

Explanation: By default, an EBS volume can only be attached to one EC2 instance at a time in the same Availability Zone. While there is a feature called EBS Multi-Attach, it is only supported for Provisioned IOPS volumes (io1/io2) and requires a clustered file system to manage concurrent access safely. For the vast majority of use cases, the one-to-one relationship holds true.
---
Question #: 765
To optimize the cost of an EFS file system that contains a mix of frequently and infrequently accessed files, what feature should be used?

A. EFS Provisioned Throughput
B. EFS Lifecycle Management
C. EFS Replication
D. EFS Backup

Answer: B

Explanation: EFS Lifecycle Management helps you save money by automatically moving files that have not been accessed for a specified period of time from the EFS Standard storage class to the lower-cost EFS Infrequent Access (IA) storage class. If a file in IA is accessed again, it is automatically moved back to Standard.
---
Question #: 766
What is the maximum size of a single object that can be stored in Amazon S3?

A. 5 GB
B. 100 GB
C. 5 TB
D. There is no limit.

Answer: C

Explanation: While the total amount of data you can store in S3 is virtually unlimited, there is a limit on the size of a single object. The maximum size for one object in S3 is 5 terabytes (TB).
---
Question #: 767
A database requires a storage volume that can provide at least 15,000 IOPS. You are using a gp3 volume. What is a valid configuration?

A. A 1000 GiB gp3 volume with 15,000 IOPS provisioned.
B. A 5000 GiB gp2 volume.
C. A 1000 GiB gp3 volume with 20,000 IOPS provisioned.
D. This is not possible with gp3.

Answer: A

Explanation: The gp3 volume type supports a maximum of 16,000 IOPS. Therefore, provisioning a volume with 15,000 IOPS is a valid configuration. To get 15,000 IOPS from a gp2 volume (B), you would need 5000 GiB (at 3 IOPS/GiB), which is much more expensive. 20,000 IOPS (C) is beyond the limit for gp3.
---
Question #: 768
Which EC2 instance feature allows an application to directly access the memory of the network adapter, bypassing the operating system kernel, to reduce latency?

A. Enhanced Networking
B. Elastic IP Address
C. Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA)
D. EBS Optimization

Answer: C

Explanation: The Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA) uses a technique called OS-bypass. This allows supported applications (typically those using MPI or NCCL libraries) to communicate directly with the network hardware, bypassing the OS kernel's network stack. This significantly reduces latency and improves inter-node communication performance, which is critical for tightly coupled HPC and ML workloads.
---
Question #: 769
When should you choose an HDD-based EBS volume (st1 or sc1) over an SSD-based volume (gp3 or io2)?

A. When you need a boot volume for an instance.
B. When the workload is characterized by large, sequential I/O operations and low cost is a priority.
C. When you need the lowest possible latency for random I/O.
D. When you need to attach the volume to multiple instances.

Answer: B

Explanation: HDD-based volumes are optimized for throughput, not IOPS. They are ideal for workloads that read or write large, contiguous blocks of data, such as streaming, log processing, or data warehousing. For these use cases, they provide good performance at a much lower price point than SSD-based volumes.
---
Question #: 770
An S3 bucket is used to store millions of log files. A data analytics job needs to read all the logs from a specific day. The objects are named with the following convention: `YYYY-MM-DD-hh-mm-ss-log.txt`. How can you optimize the S3 GET request performance for this job?

A. Use a more random naming convention for the object keys.
B. Enable versioning on the S3 bucket.
C. Store the logs in a single, large compressed file instead of many small files.
D. The performance will be optimal by default.

Answer: A

Explanation: Naming S3 objects with sequential, date-based prefixes can sometimes lead to performance hot-spotting, as all the write (or read) activity is concentrated on a single partition within the S3 index. By introducing some randomness to the beginning of the object key (e.g., a hashed value prefix like `A1B2-YYYY-MM-DD-...`), you can distribute the requests across multiple partitions, allowing S3 to scale its performance more effectively.
---
Question #: 771
What is the primary use case for Amazon EC2 instance store?

A. Long-term, durable storage for databases.
B. A shared file system for a cluster of instances.
C. Temporary storage for caches, buffers, or scratch space for data that is replicated elsewhere.
D. A boot volume for an EC2 instance.

Answer: C

Explanation: Because instance store is ephemeral (non-persistent), it should never be used for data that needs to be durable. However, its extremely high performance and low latency make it an excellent choice for temporary storage. Common use cases include caches for web servers, buffer space for data processing jobs, or scratch disks for applications where the final results are written to a persistent store like S3 or EBS.
---
Question #: 772
A company needs to launch several EC2 instances for a high-performance, tightly coupled scientific computing application. The application requires the lowest possible inter-node latency. Which placement group strategy is required?

A. Spread
B. Cluster
C. Partition
D. Any placement group will provide low latency.

Answer: B

Explanation: A Cluster placement group is the only strategy that is explicitly designed to minimize network latency between instances. It achieves this by placing the instances on the same physical rack within a single Availability Zone, ensuring the shortest possible network path between them.
---
Question #: 773
What are two key characteristics of the General Purpose SSD (gp3) EBS volume type? (Choose TWO)

A. It is an HDD-based volume.
B. It allows you to provision IOPS and throughput independently from storage size.
C. It is designed for the highest possible durability of 99.999%.
D. It provides a baseline of 3,000 IOPS and 125 MB/s of throughput included with the price of storage.
E. It can be attached to multiple EC2 instances simultaneously by default.

Answer: B, D

Explanation: The defining features of gp3 are its flexibility and baseline performance. It decouples performance from size (B), allowing you to configure the IOPS and throughput you need. It also comes with a generous baseline performance (D) that is sufficient for a wide range of applications, making it a very cost-effective and flexible choice.
---
Question #: 774
To get the highest network throughput between an EC2 instance and an S3 bucket in the same region, what should be done?

A. Use an S3 VPC Interface Endpoint.
B. Launch the EC2 instance in a cluster placement group.
C. Use the AWS CLI with parallel uploads/downloads enabled by default, or use a tool that supports concurrent requests.
D. Use S3 Transfer Acceleration.

Answer: C

Explanation: S3 can handle a massive amount of throughput. The bottleneck is often the client's ability to send a single stream of data fast enough. By using a tool that can make multiple concurrent connections to S3 (like the AWS CLI for large files, or custom SDK code), you can parallelize the data transfer and better utilize the available network bandwidth of your EC2 instance and S3's scalable front-end.
---
Question #: 775
Which EC2 instance type is designed as a balance of compute, memory, and networking resources, making it suitable for a wide variety of diverse workloads?

A. Compute Optimized (C-family)
B. Storage Optimized (I-family)
C. Memory Optimized (R-family)
D. General Purpose (M-family or T-family)

Answer: D

Explanation: The General Purpose instance families, such as the M-family (e.g., m5, m6g) and the T-family (e.g., t3, t4g), are engineered to provide a balanced combination of resources. They are the workhorses of EC2 and are a good starting point for many different applications, including web servers, small-to-mid-sized databases, and development environments.
---
Question #: 776
An application uses an EFS file system and is experiencing performance issues. The CloudWatch metrics show a high `PercentIOLimit`. What does this indicate?

A. The file system is running out of storage space.
B. The EC2 instances are not able to connect to the file system.
C. The file system is operating at its maximum IOPS limit for an extended period.
D. The file system is in the wrong Availability Zone.

Answer: C

Explanation: The `PercentIOLimit` metric for EFS indicates how close the file system is to its IOPS limit, which is based on the performance mode and size. A consistently high value for this metric (near 100%) means the file system is being throttled because the application is driving more I/O operations than the file system can handle. This would suggest a need to switch to Max I/O mode or use a different storage solution if the workload is not a good fit for EFS.
---
Question #: 777
What is a primary advantage of using an EBS-optimized instance for an I/O-intensive application?

A. It reduces the cost of EBS snapshots.
B. It provides a dedicated network path for EBS traffic, minimizing contention with other network traffic from the instance.
C. It allows you to attach more EBS volumes than a standard instance.
D. It automatically selects the best EBS volume type for your workload.

Answer: B

Explanation: On non-optimized instances, the traffic to and from EBS volumes shares the same network interface as all other network traffic (e.g., to the internet or other instances). On an EBS-optimized instance, there is a dedicated, separate bandwidth allocation just for EBS traffic. This prevents your storage performance from being impacted by a burst of network traffic, and vice-versa, ensuring consistent I/O.
---
Question #: 778
Which S3 feature would you use to automatically create a copy of all newly uploaded objects into a bucket in another AWS region for disaster recovery?

A. S3 Versioning
B. S3 Lifecycle Policies
C. S3 Cross-Region Replication (CRR)
D. S3 Batch Operations

Answer: C

Explanation: S3 Cross-Region Replication is the service feature specifically designed for this purpose. You can configure a replication rule on a source bucket that tells S3 to automatically and asynchronously copy all new objects (or objects matching a certain prefix) to a specified destination bucket in a different AWS region.
---
Question #: 779
You need to create a temporary file system on an EC2 instance for scratch data. The data needs to be accessed at the highest possible speed. Which storage should you use?

A. An EBS Cold HDD (sc1) volume.
B. An EFS file system in Max I/O mode.
C. The instance's local NVMe instance store.
D. An EBS General Purpose (gp3) volume.

Answer: C

Explanation: For temporary, high-speed scratch space, the instance store is the ideal choice. It is a physically attached SSD that offers the lowest latency and highest IOPS of any storage option available to an EC2 instance. Its ephemeral nature is acceptable because the data is only needed temporarily.
---
Question #: 780
A workload requires a shared file system that is accessible from thousands of EC2 instances and scales its throughput as the amount of data grows. Which service is designed for this elastic scaling?

A. Amazon EBS
B. Amazon FSx for Lustre
C. Amazon S3
D. Amazon EFS

Answer: D

Explanation: Amazon EFS is designed for exactly this type of elastic, scalable, shared access. Its performance and capacity scale automatically as your needs change. It can support thousands of concurrent connections and is a fully managed service, making it easy to deploy and use for scale-out applications.
---
Question #: 781
What is the key difference in performance characteristics between an st1 and an io2 EBS volume?

A. st1 is SSD-based, while io2 is HDD-based.
B. st1 is optimized for high sequential throughput (MB/s), while io2 is optimized for high random IOPS.
C. st1 has higher durability than io2.
D. st1 can be attached to multiple instances, while io2 cannot.

Answer: B

Explanation: This highlights the core difference between throughput-optimized and IOPS-optimized volumes. st1 (an HDD volume) is designed to perform well when reading or writing large, sequential blocks of data, measuring its performance in MB/s. io2 (an SSD volume) is designed to perform well with small, random reads and writes, measuring its performance in IOPS.
---
Question #: 782
To achieve the best S3 performance for an application that frequently uploads and downloads many small objects, what is a key architectural consideration?

A. Use a single, sequential process to handle all S3 requests.
B. Design the application to make multiple, parallel requests to S3 simultaneously.
C. Compress all the small objects into a single large archive before uploading.
D. Use the S3 Standard-IA storage class.

Answer: B

Explanation: S3 is a massively parallel, distributed system. To leverage its scale, your application should be designed to interact with it in parallel. By using multiple threads or an asynchronous I/O model to make many requests at once, you can achieve a much higher total throughput than by making one request at a time.
---
Question #: 783
Which of the following EC2 features is designed to provide fault tolerance for a distributed application by spreading instances across distinct hardware?

A. Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA)
B. Partition Placement Group
C. EBS Optimization
D. Burstable Performance

Answer: B

Explanation: A Partition placement group is a high-availability feature. It divides your instances into logical partitions (with each partition on a separate physical rack). This ensures that a hardware failure on a single rack will only affect the instances within one partition, limiting the "blast radius" of the failure for your application.
---
Question #: 784
You need to run a high-performance database on an EC2 instance. The database requires at least 50,000 IOPS. Which EBS volume type can meet this requirement?

A. gp2
B. gp3
C. st1
D. io2

Answer: D

Explanation: The maximum IOPS for a gp3 volume is 16,000. To achieve 50,000 IOPS, you must use a Provisioned IOPS SSD volume. The io1 and io2 volume types can be provisioned with up to 64,000 IOPS (and io2 Block Express up to 256,000 IOPS), making them the correct choice for this high-performance requirement.
---
Question #: 785
An application uses Amazon EFS. To lower costs, the company wants to move files that haven't been accessed in 30 days to a cheaper storage tier. How can this be automated?

A. By enabling EFS Intelligent-Tiering.
B. By creating an EFS Lifecycle policy.
C. By writing a Lambda function to manually move the files.
D. This is not possible with EFS.

Answer: B

Explanation: EFS Lifecycle Management is the feature that automates this process. You can create a lifecycle policy that specifies a time period (e.g., 30 days of inactivity). EFS will then automatically and transparently move any file that hasn't been accessed within that period from the EFS Standard tier to the lower-cost EFS Infrequent Access (IA) tier.
---
Question #: 786
A team is building a solution that requires a high-performance, shared file system for a Linux-based HPC cluster. The main priority is processing speed. Which AWS service is purpose-built for this?

B. Amazon EFS in General Purpose mode
C. Amazon FSx for Lustre
D. Amazon EBS with Multi-Attach

Answer: C

Explanation: FSx for Lustre is a service that provides a file system designed for high-performance computing. Lustre is a popular open-source parallel file system, and FSx provides a fully managed version of it, offering extremely high throughput and low latencies that are ideal for HPC workloads.
---
Question #: 787
What happens to the data on an EBS volume when the EC2 instance it is attached to is terminated?

A. The EBS volume is always deleted along with the instance.
B. The EBS volume is always detached and preserved.
C. By default, the root EBS volume is deleted, while any non-root volumes are preserved. This behavior can be changed.
D. The data is automatically moved to an S3 bucket.

Answer: C

Explanation: The behavior depends on the "Delete on Termination" flag for the volume attachment. For the root volume of an instance, this flag is set to "true" by default. For any other (non-root) data volumes that you attach, the flag is set to "false" by default. You can change this setting for any volume.
---
Question #: 788
What is a key performance difference between an S3 bucket and an EFS file system?

A. S3 offers massively scalable throughput and request rates for objects, while EFS offers low-latency, POSIX-compliant file system access.
B. S3 is faster for small, random file access.
C. EFS has higher durability than S3.
D. EFS can store larger individual files than S3.

Answer: A

Explanation: They are optimized for different access patterns. S3 is an object store built for massive parallelism, making it ideal for high-throughput streaming of large objects or handling millions of concurrent requests for smaller objects. EFS is a file system that provides the semantics and low-latency metadata operations (like listing directories, renaming files) that are expected from a traditional network file system.
---
Question #: 789
You need to launch a memory-intensive application that processes large datasets in RAM. Which EC2 instance family should you primarily consider?

A. T-family
B. C-family
C. R-family
D. I-family

Answer: C

Explanation: The R-family of instances is memory-optimized. They have the highest ratio of RAM to vCPU, making them the ideal choice for workloads like in-memory databases, large-scale caching, and real-time big data analytics that require large amounts of memory.
---
Question #: 790
A gp3 EBS volume is configured with 500 GiB of storage and 500 MB/s of throughput. What is its IOPS capability?

A. 3,000 IOPS
B. 5,000 IOPS
C. 10,000 IOPS
D. It must be explicitly provisioned.

Answer: A

Explanation: A gp3 volume includes a baseline of 3,000 IOPS and 125 MB/s of throughput regardless of its size. You have provisioned additional throughput, but since you have not explicitly provisioned additional IOPS, the volume will have the baseline of 3,000 IOPS.
---
Question #: 791
What is the purpose of an S3 bucket's "prefix" in relation to performance?

A. It encrypts the objects stored under that prefix.
B. It defines the storage class for the objects.
C. It acts as a partitioning key. S3 can scale to support very high request rates for each unique prefix.
D. It is a tag used for billing purposes.

Answer: C

Explanation: S3 achieves its massive scale by partitioning its index based on object prefixes. Each prefix can scale to handle thousands of requests per second. Therefore, by distributing your objects and requests across multiple prefixes, you can achieve a much higher aggregate request rate than if you stored all objects under a single prefix.
---
Question #: 792
An application requires a minimum of 400 MB/s of sequential throughput for processing large log files. The data size is 1 TB. Which EBS volume is the most cost-effective option?

A. A 1 TB gp3 volume with 400 MB/s provisioned.
B. A 1 TB st1 volume.
C. A 1 TB io2 volume with 10,000 IOPS.
D. A 400 GB sc1 volume.

Answer: B

Explanation: The workload is for large, sequential throughput, which is the exact use case for the Throughput Optimized HDD (st1) volume type. A 1 TB st1 volume can burst to 500 MB/s and has a baseline of 40 MB/s per TB, so it easily meets the 400 MB/s requirement. It will be significantly cheaper than a gp3 or io2 volume configured for the same throughput.
---
Question #: 793
A company is running a tightly coupled molecular modeling simulation on a large cluster of EC2 instances. Which combination of features would provide the best performance?

A. A spread placement group and an Application Load Balancer.
B. A partition placement group and EFS storage.
C. A cluster placement group and an Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA).
D. A Dedicated Host and EBS Multi-Attach.

Answer: C

Explanation: For tightly coupled HPC workloads, you need the lowest possible latency and highest possible bandwidth between nodes. A Cluster placement group places the instances physically close together. An Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA) provides a specialized network interface that bypasses the OS kernel to provide extremely low-latency communication, which is ideal for the MPI communication patterns used in these simulations.

Which of the following is a key characteristic of Amazon S3 storage?

A. It is a block storage service.
B. It is a file storage service.
C. It is an object storage service with a flat namespace.
D. It is an ephemeral storage service.

Answer: C

Explanation: S3 is an object storage service. This means it stores data as objects within buckets. Each object consists of the data itself, a unique key (its name), and metadata. Unlike a file system, it has a flat structure (though the use of prefixes in keys can simulate a hierarchy).

Question #: 795
An EC2 instance is performing poorly. CloudWatch metrics show 100% CPU utilization and a high `DiskReadOps` metric for its EBS volume. What is the most likely bottleneck?

A. The instance is network-bound.
B. The instance is CPU-bound and potentially I/O-bound.
C. The EBS volume is configured with too much throughput.
D. The instance is memory-bound.

Answer: B

Explanation: 100% CPU utilization clearly indicates that the instance is CPU-bound; it does not have enough processing power for its workload. A high `DiskReadOps` (IOPS) metric suggests that it is also heavily using its storage. This combination means the instance is likely bottlenecked on both CPU and I/O, and a larger instance type or a volume with higher IOPS may be needed.
---
Question #: 796
When is it appropriate to use an EFS file system in "Max I/O" performance mode?

A. For a latency-sensitive web content management system.
B. For a large-scale, parallel data processing job that needs to maximize aggregate throughput.
C. When you need to provision a specific level of throughput.
D. When cost is the most important factor.

Answer: B

Explanation: Max I/O mode is designed for applications that are highly parallel and need to achieve the highest possible aggregate throughput and IOPS from the file system. It trades a small amount of metadata latency for this increased scale, making it ideal for big data analytics, media processing, and large-scale simulations.
---
Question #: 797
You are using an EBS Provisioned IOPS (io2) volume. What is the maximum ratio of provisioned IOPS to requested volume size (in GiB)?

A. 100:1
B. 500:1
C. 1,000:1
D. 3,000:1

Answer: C

Explanation: For io1 and io2 volumes, there is a maximum ratio of IOPS to size that you can provision. For io2 volumes, this ratio is 1,000 IOPS per GiB. This means, for example, a 10 GiB io2 volume can be provisioned with a maximum of 10,000 IOPS.

Question #: 798
A web application serves a large amount of static content (images, CSS, JavaScript) from an EFS file system mounted across a fleet of EC2 web servers. Users are reporting slow page load times. What is the BEST way to improve the performance for a global user base?

A. Switch the EFS performance mode to Max I/O.
B. Increase the size of the EC2 instances.
C. Use Amazon CloudFront as a CDN to cache the static content at edge locations closer to the users.
D. Increase the Provisioned Throughput of the EFS file system.

Answer: C

Explanation: The best way to improve performance for delivering static content to a global audience is to use a Content Delivery Network (CDN) like Amazon CloudFront. CloudFront will cache the static assets at its numerous edge locations around the world. When a user requests an asset, it will be served from a nearby edge location instead of making a long trip back to your EFS file system, dramatically reducing latency and improving performance.
---
Question #: 799
A popular news website is experiencing very high read traffic on its articles, which are stored in an Amazon RDS for MySQL database. The database is struggling to keep up with the load, causing slow page load times. What is the BEST solution to improve read performance and scalability?

A. Enable Multi-AZ on the RDS instance.
B. Increase the instance size of the RDS database (vertical scaling).
C. Create one or more Read Replicas of the RDS instance and direct read traffic to them.
D. Switch the EBS volume type on the RDS instance to Provisioned IOPS (io2).

Answer: C

Explanation: Read Replicas are designed for this exact use case. They are asynchronous copies of the primary database that can be used to serve read traffic, offloading the primary instance and significantly improving the scalability of read-heavy applications. Multi-AZ (A) is for high availability, not performance scaling. While vertical scaling (B) or faster storage (D) might help temporarily, they are less scalable and less cost-effective than using Read Replicas.
---
Question #: 800
What is a key architectural difference between Amazon Aurora and a standard Amazon RDS database?

A. Aurora can only be deployed in a single Availability Zone.
B. Aurora separates the compute layer from a shared, distributed storage layer, while RDS combines them on a single instance.
C. Aurora uses EBS volumes for storage, while RDS uses a custom file system.
D. Aurora does not support Read Replicas.

Answer: B

Explanation: The fundamental innovation of Aurora is its cloud-native, log-structured storage volume that is shared across the compute nodes in the cluster. This separation allows for faster failover, improved performance, and more efficient scaling compared to the traditional monolithic architecture of standard RDS, where compute and storage are tightly coupled.
---
Question #: 801
An application requires a database with low-latency (single-digit millisecond) read and write performance for key-value and document data. The database must be able to scale to handle millions of requests per second. Which AWS database service is the best fit?

A. Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL
B. Amazon Redshift
C. Amazon DynamoDB
D. Amazon Aurora

Answer: C

Explanation: Amazon DynamoDB is a fully managed, serverless NoSQL database designed for high-performance applications at any scale. It excels at providing consistent, single-digit millisecond latency for key-value and document workloads, making it ideal for applications like mobile apps, gaming, and IoT.
---
Question #: 802
A gaming application uses a DynamoDB table to store user scores. To display a leaderboard, the application needs to frequently query the table to get the top 10 scores for a specific game. The table's primary key is `UserId`. How can you optimize these leaderboard queries?

A. Use a Scan operation with a filter expression.
B. Create a Global Secondary Index (GSI) with a partition key of `GameId` and a sort key of `Score`.
C. Increase the provisioned write capacity of the table.
D. Store the leaderboard data in an S3 bucket.

Answer: B

Explanation: A Scan operation (A) is very inefficient as it reads every item in the table. The most efficient way to query on non-key attributes is to create a Global Secondary Index (GSI). A GSI with `GameId` as the partition key and `Score` as the sort key would allow you to directly and efficiently query for all scores for a specific game, sorted from high to low.
---
Question #: 803
A company wants to add an in-memory cache to their application to reduce the latency of frequently accessed database queries and offload the read traffic from their RDS instance. They need a simple key-value cache. Which AWS service is designed for this?

A. Amazon DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX)
B. Amazon S3
C. Amazon ElastiCache
D. Amazon RDS Read Replicas

Answer: C

Explanation: Amazon ElastiCache is a fully managed in-memory caching service. It supports popular engines like Redis and Memcached and is the standard solution for implementing a caching layer in front of a database like RDS to improve read performance and reduce latency. DAX (A) is specifically for DynamoDB, not RDS.
---
Question #: 804
What is the primary function of Amazon DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX)?

A. It is a globally replicated version of a DynamoDB table.
B. It is a fully managed, highly available, in-memory cache specifically for Amazon DynamoDB.
C. It is a tool for accelerating the migration of data into DynamoDB.
D. It is a search service for DynamoDB.

Answer: B

Explanation: DAX is a purpose-built, write-through caching service for DynamoDB. It is API-compatible with DynamoDB, so you can often use it with minimal code changes. It provides microsecond-level read performance for cached items, dramatically accelerating read-heavy applications that use DynamoDB.
---
Question #: 805
When you promote an Amazon RDS Read Replica to become a standalone database instance, what happens to the replication from the original primary instance?

A. The replication becomes synchronous.
B. The original primary instance becomes a replica of the new instance.
C. The replication link is permanently broken, and the new instance becomes an independent, writable database.
D. The promotion fails if the primary instance is still running.

Answer: C

Explanation: The promotion process is a one-way operation. When you promote a Read Replica, it completes its final replication from the source, and then the replication link is severed. It becomes a completely separate database instance that you can write to, and it will no longer receive updates from its former primary.
---
Question #: 806
Which of the following is a key feature of the Amazon Aurora storage architecture?

A. Data is written to a single, highly durable EBS volume.
B. Data is stored in a single shard, which can be resized.
C. The storage volume is striped across hundreds of disks and automatically grows in size as needed, up to 128 TB.
D. Data is stored in-memory, with periodic backups to S3.

Answer: C

Explanation: Aurora's storage is a unique, distributed, and self-healing system. It is designed for high performance and availability. The underlying storage volume automatically scales in 10 GB increments as your data grows, up to a maximum of 128 TB, without you needing to provision it in advance.
---
Question #: 807
An application is experiencing high read traffic on a DynamoDB table, and the cost of provisioned read capacity is becoming too high. The application can tolerate slightly stale data (a few seconds old). What is the most cost-effective solution to reduce the read load on the table?

A. Increase the provisioned write capacity.
B. Implement an Amazon ElastiCache for Redis cluster to cache the most frequent query results.
C. Switch the table to On-Demand capacity mode.
D. Create a Global Secondary Index.

Answer: B

Explanation: Implementing a caching layer with ElastiCache is a classic pattern for reducing read load and cost. By caching the results of common read queries, you can serve many requests from the fast, in-memory cache, which is often cheaper per read than hitting the DynamoDB table directly. DAX is also an option, but ElastiCache is a more general-purpose caching solution that works well here.
---
Question #: 808
What are the two types of database cluster endpoints provided by an Amazon Aurora cluster?

A. A Reader Endpoint and a Writer Endpoint
B. A Primary Endpoint and a Secondary Endpoint
C. A Cluster Endpoint and an Instance Endpoint
D. A Public Endpoint and a Private Endpoint

Answer: C

Explanation: An Aurora cluster provides a single "Cluster Endpoint" (also called the writer endpoint) that always points to the current primary/writer instance. It also provides a "Reader Endpoint" that acts as a load balancer for all the Aurora Replicas in the cluster. Additionally, each instance in the cluster (both the writer and the readers) has its own unique "Instance Endpoint".
---
Question #: 809
A company uses Amazon ElastiCache for Redis as a user session store for their web application. They need to ensure that the session store is highly available and can withstand the failure of a node. What ElastiCache for Redis feature should be enabled?

A. Multi-AZ with Automatic Failover
B. Read Replicas
C. Cluster Mode
D. S3 Backup and Restore

Answer: A

Explanation: To achieve high availability, you should enable the Multi-AZ feature for your ElastiCache for Redis replication group. This creates replica nodes in a different Availability Zone from the primary node. If the primary node fails, ElastiCache will automatically promote one of the replicas to be the new primary, minimizing downtime.
---
Question #: 810
An application performs a large number of reads on a DynamoDB table. The reads are eventually consistent. To improve performance, a DAX cluster is placed in front of the table. What happens when the application requests an item that is not in the DAX cache (a cache miss)?

A. DAX returns an error, and the application must query DynamoDB directly.
B. DAX passes the read request through to DynamoDB, retrieves the item, and then caches it for subsequent reads.
C. DAX waits for the item to be replicated to the cache from DynamoDB.
D. The application must write the item to DAX first.

Answer: B

Explanation: DAX uses a "read-through" caching strategy. On a cache miss, DAX seamlessly fetches the required item from the underlying DynamoDB table on the application's behalf. It then stores the item in its own in-memory cache (the "Item Cache") before returning it to the application. This ensures that the next time the same item is requested, it can be served directly from the cache with microsecond latency.
---
Question #: 811
You have an RDS for PostgreSQL database in `us-east-1`. For disaster recovery, you need to have a copy of the database available in `us-west-2`. The recovery time objective (RTO) is about 15 minutes, and the recovery point objective (RPO) is less than 5 minutes. What RDS feature should you use?

A. A Multi-AZ deployment in `us-east-1`.
B. A daily automated snapshot copied to `us-west-2`.
C. A Cross-Region Read Replica in `us-west-2`.
D. A manual snapshot taken every hour and copied to `us-west-2`.

Answer: C

Explanation: A Cross-Region Read Replica is the ideal solution for this DR scenario. It uses asynchronous replication to keep a replica in the DR region up-to-date, which typically results in a replication lag of seconds or a few minutes (meeting the RPO). In a disaster, you can promote this replica to a standalone, writable instance in under 15 minutes (meeting the RTO). Multi-AZ (A) is for in-region high availability, and snapshot-based methods (B, D) would have a much higher RPO and RTO.
---
Question #: 812
Which of the following is a key characteristic of Amazon Aurora's storage system?

A. It is based on a single, large EBS io2 volume.
B. It replicates six copies of your data across three Availability Zones.
C. It requires you to manually provision storage in advance.
D. It is limited to a maximum size of 16 TB.

Answer: B

Explanation: Aurora's storage is designed for extreme durability and availability. Each 10 GB segment of your database volume is replicated six times across three AZs (two copies in each AZ). This architecture can tolerate the loss of an entire AZ plus one additional node without any data loss and the loss of an entire AZ without any loss of write availability.
---
Question #: 813
Which of the following is a good use case for Amazon ElastiCache for Memcached over Redis?

A. When you need to store complex data types like lists, sets, and hashes.
B. When you need high availability with replication and automatic failover.
C. When you need a simple, multi-threaded, in-memory object cache with the lowest possible latency.
D. When you need to persist your cache data to disk.

Answer: C

Explanation: Memcached is simpler than Redis. Its primary strengths are its multi-threaded architecture, which can lead to higher throughput on multi-core instances for simple get/set operations, and its simplicity. It is an excellent choice when all you need is a straightforward, volatile, key-value cache. Redis (A, B, D) offers many more features like data persistence, replication, and complex data structures.
---
Question #: 814
A DynamoDB table is configured in Provisioned Capacity mode with 100 RCUs. The application is performing 100 strongly consistent reads per second, and each item is 4 KB in size. Will the reads be throttled?

A. No, because the number of reads per second is equal to the number of RCUs.
B. Yes, because a strongly consistent read of 4 KB consumes 1 RCU, and 100 reads/sec will consume 100 RCUs, leaving no room for variance.
C. Yes, because each 4 KB strongly consistent read consumes 1 RCU, so 100 reads per second consumes 100 RCUs exactly, leaving no buffer.
D. Yes, because a strongly consistent read consumes twice the capacity of an eventually consistent read, and each 4 KB item requires one read unit. Thus 100 reads/sec will require 100 RCUs, leaving no buffer.
*Correction:* Let's break down the calculation. A Read Capacity Unit (RCU) represents one strongly consistent read per second for an item up to 4 KB. An eventually consistent read is half that (0.5 RCU). The application is performing 100 strongly consistent reads/sec of 4 KB items. This will consume exactly 100 * 1 = 100 RCUs. While this matches the provisioned capacity, any slight variance or burst in traffic will lead to throttling. Therefore, the operation is at risk of being throttled.

Answer: D

Explanation: One RCU provides one strongly consistent read per second for an item up to 4 KB. Since the application is performing exactly 100 such reads per second, it is consuming all 100 of the provisioned RCUs. This leaves absolutely no buffer. Any slight burst in traffic or uneven distribution of reads over the second will result in throttling. The best practice is to provision some headroom.
---
Question #: 815
You are using an Aurora MySQL cluster with one writer and two reader instances. Your application is sending all its database queries, including reads and writes, to the cluster's "Reader Endpoint". What is the result?

A. All queries will be load-balanced across the two reader instances.
B. All write operations will fail, and read operations will be load-balanced across the readers.
C. All queries will be sent to the writer instance.
D. The Reader Endpoint will automatically forward write operations to the writer instance.

Answer: B

Explanation: The Reader Endpoint is specifically designed to load-balance read-only connections (`SELECT` queries) across all the available Aurora Replicas in the cluster. It will reject any data modification language (DML) statements like `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE`. To perform write operations, the application must connect to the Cluster Endpoint (the writer endpoint).
---
Question #: 816
What is the "Lazy Loading" caching strategy in ElastiCache?

A. The application writes data to the cache and the database at the same time.
B. The application pre-loads all anticipated data into the cache.
C. The application first requests data from the cache. If it's not there (a cache miss), the application retrieves it from the database and then writes it into the cache.
D. The application only writes data to the cache, and the cache is responsible for writing it to the database.

Answer: C

Explanation: Lazy Loading is the most common caching strategy. It loads data into the cache on-demand. When the application needs data, it checks the cache first. If the data is present (a cache hit), it's returned immediately. If not (a cache miss), the application queries the main database, retrieves the data, and then populates the cache with that data so it will be available for the next request.
---
Question #: 817
An application is read-heavy and uses DynamoDB. The developers want to implement a cache to improve read performance, but they do not want to make any changes to the application's data access logic, which already uses the standard DynamoDB SDK. What is the most suitable caching service?

A. Amazon ElastiCache for Redis
B. Amazon ElastiCache for Memcached
C. Amazon DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX)
D. A custom cache built on an EC2 instance.

Answer: C

Explanation: DAX is the ideal solution for this scenario because it is API-compatible with DynamoDB. The DAX client is designed as a drop-in replacement for the standard DynamoDB client. This means you can often gain the benefits of a fully managed, in-memory cache with only minimal code changes related to client initialization, without having to rewrite your application's read/write logic.
---
Question #: 818
To create an RDS Read Replica in a different region from the primary database, what must be enabled on the primary database instance?

A. Multi-AZ deployment
B. Automated backups (with a retention period greater than 0)
C. Enhanced Monitoring
D. IAM DB Authentication

Answer: B

Explanation: Amazon RDS uses the binary logs (or transaction logs) from the database engine to create and synchronize Read Replicas. The mechanism for retaining these logs on RDS is the automated backup feature. Therefore, you must have automated backups enabled on the source RDS instance before you can create a Read Replica from it.
---
Question #: 819
What is the primary benefit of using Amazon Aurora Global Database?

A. It allows you to run different database engines (e.g., MySQL and PostgreSQL) in the same cluster.
B. It provides a low-latency, cross-region disaster recovery solution with an RPO of seconds and an RTO of less than a minute.
C. It encrypts all data at rest using a globally replicated KMS key.
D. It automatically scales the number of writer instances based on load.

Answer: B

Explanation: Aurora Global Database is designed for fast, cross-region disaster recovery and for serving low-latency reads to a global audience. It uses dedicated replication infrastructure to achieve a typical replication lag of less than one second (low RPO). In a disaster, you can promote a secondary region to be the new primary, taking full read/write workloads, in under a minute (low RTO).
---
Question #: 820
A DynamoDB table stores user session data. To automatically remove sessions that are more than 24 hours old, which feature should be used?

A. A Global Secondary Index (GSI)
B. A Scan operation in a nightly batch job.
C. The Time to Live (TTL) feature.
D. DynamoDB Streams with a Lambda function.

Answer: C

Explanation: The TTL feature is designed for this exact purpose. You can enable TTL on your table and specify an attribute that contains an expiration timestamp (in Unix epoch format). DynamoDB will then automatically and continuously check for items where the timestamp has passed and delete them from the table, at no additional cost for the deletes.
---
Question #: 821
What is the "Write-Through" caching strategy in ElastiCache?

A. The application writes data only to the cache and assumes it will be persisted later.
B. The application writes data to the database, and the database is responsible for updating the cache.
C. The application first writes data to the cache and then, upon success, writes the same data to the database.
D. The application reads data from the cache and writes it to the database.

Answer: C

Explanation: In a write-through strategy, the cache is kept in sync with the database because every write goes through the cache first. The application updates the cache and then the database. This ensures that data in the cache is never stale, but it adds a small amount of latency to every write operation.
---
Question #: 822
Which of the following Aurora cluster endpoints should an application use to take advantage of load balancing across multiple Aurora Replicas?

A. The Cluster Endpoint
B. The Reader Endpoint
C. An Instance Endpoint of a specific replica
D. The private IP address of a replica

Answer: B

Explanation: The Reader Endpoint provides a single DNS name that an application can connect to for read-only queries. This endpoint will automatically load-balance the connections across all the available Aurora Replicas (read-only instances) in the cluster, distributing the read load and improving scalability.
---
Question #: 823
A large batch job needs to perform a full table scan on a massive DynamoDB table. To avoid impacting the performance of the main application, which uses the same table, what is the best approach?

A. Temporarily increase the table's provisioned read capacity during the scan.
B. Use a Scan operation but set a low page size limit.
C. Export the table data to S3 using a Point-in-Time Recovery export or AWS Glue, and perform the scan on the data in S3.
D. Create a DAX cluster just for the batch job.

Answer: C

Explanation: Performing a full table scan on a production table can consume all of its provisioned read capacity, throttling the main application. The best practice for large-scale analytics is to export the data to a data lake like S3. You can then use tools like Amazon Athena, AWS Glue, or Amazon EMR to analyze the data in S3 without having any performance impact on the live DynamoDB table.
---
Question #: 824
When comparing ElastiCache for Redis and Memcached, which of the following features is ONLY available in Redis? (Choose TWO)

A. In-memory key-value storage
B. Data persistence (snapshotting)
C. Multi-threaded architecture
D. Support for complex data types like lists, sets, and sorted sets
E. Sub-millisecond latency

Answer: B, D

Explanation: Redis is a more feature-rich caching engine. It supports persisting data to disk through snapshots (RDB) and append-only files (AOF) (B). It also has native support for a wide variety of powerful data structures beyond simple key-value strings, including lists, hashes, and sorted sets (D). Memcached is simpler and multi-threaded (C), while both provide in-memory storage (A) and low latency (E).
---
Question #: 825
An application needs to scale its read traffic. The CTO has decided to use an RDS Read Replica. What is a critical application design consideration for this architecture?

A. The application must be able to handle a failover to another region.
B. The application's code must be modified to direct read queries to the replica's endpoint and write queries to the primary's endpoint.
C. The application must use the same instance size for the primary and the replica.
D. The application must connect to the replica using SSL/TLS.

Answer: B

Explanation: This is a crucial implementation detail. A Read Replica has its own unique DNS endpoint. To effectively use it for read scaling, the application needs to be architected to separate its read and write traffic. It must establish two connections (or use a smart driver) and send all `SELECT` queries to the replica's endpoint and all `INSERT`/`UPDATE`/`DELETE` queries to the primary instance's endpoint.
---
Question #: 826
Which feature allows an Amazon Aurora database cluster to span multiple AWS regions for disaster recovery and low-latency global reads?

A. Aurora Multi-Master
B. Aurora Serverless
C. Aurora Global Database
D. Aurora Parallel Query

Answer: C

Explanation: Aurora Global Database is the feature designed for this purpose. It creates a primary cluster in one region and allows you to create secondary, read-only clusters in up to five other regions. It uses dedicated, low-latency replication infrastructure to keep the secondary clusters up-to-date, providing a robust solution for global applications and disaster recovery.
---
Question #: 827
A DynamoDB table uses a composite primary key (a partition key and a sort key). How does a `Query` operation work on this table?

A. It can search for any attribute in the table.
B. It must specify the value of the partition key, and can optionally specify conditions on the sort key.
C. It must specify the value of the sort key.
D. It reads every item in the table.

Answer: B

Explanation: A `Query` operation is highly efficient but has a specific access pattern. You must provide an exact value for the partition key. You can then optionally provide conditions for the sort key (e.g., `begins_with`, `between`, `>`, `<`) to retrieve a specific range of items within that partition. This is much more efficient than a `Scan`.
---
Question #: 828
What are the two caching capacity modes available for a DynamoDB table?

A. Provisioned and On-Demand
B. Hot and Cold
C. Read-Through and Write-Through
D. Standard and High-Performance

Answer: A

Explanation: Just like the table itself, a DAX cluster in front of DynamoDB can be configured in two capacity modes. Provisioned mode allows you to specify a fixed number of nodes for predictable performance, while On-Demand mode automatically scales the number of nodes up and down based on your application's traffic, providing a pay-per-request model. The question is about the DynamoDB table itself, not DAX. Let's re-read.

Answer: A

Explanation: A DynamoDB table has two capacity modes for handling reads and writes. **Provisioned Capacity** mode is where you specify the number of read and write capacity units per second that your application requires. **On-Demand** mode is where DynamoDB instantly accommodates your workload as it ramps up or down, and you pay per request.
---
Question #: 829
A company uses ElastiCache for Redis to store frequently accessed product catalog data. The data in the primary RDS database is updated infrequently. Which caching strategy is most appropriate to ensure the cache is always up-to-date?

A. Lazy Loading
B. Write-Through
C. A Time-to-Live (TTL) of 5 minutes on each item.
D. A combination of Lazy Loading and Write-Through, where writes also update or invalidate the cache.

Answer: D

Explanation: For data that changes infrequently, a pure Lazy Loading strategy could result in users seeing stale data until the TTL expires. The most robust pattern is to combine them. The application uses Lazy Loading for reads. When the data is updated in the database (the infrequent part), the application also executes a command to either update the new value in the cache (write-through) or, more simply, delete the old value from the cache (cache invalidation). The next read will then be a cache miss and will load the fresh data.
---
Question #: 830
What is the "cluster cache" in an Aurora database cluster?

A. An Amazon ElastiCache cluster that is automatically provisioned with the database.
B. It refers to the fact that the buffer cache (memory for holding data pages) is shared across all nodes in the cluster and survives a database restart.
C. A feature that caches query results in the storage layer.
D. The DNS cache for the cluster endpoints.

Answer: B

Explanation: A unique feature of the Aurora architecture is its "log-is-the-database" design. The buffer cache process is separated from the database engine process. This means that if the database process crashes and restarts, the buffer cache is preserved in memory. This "crash recovery" avoids the need to re-read data pages from disk, resulting in a much faster restart time (seconds) compared to traditional databases.
---
Question #: 831
You have a DynamoDB table with a large number of items. You need to perform a query that retrieves items based on an attribute that is not part of the primary key. The query needs to be fast and efficient. What should you do?

A. Use a Scan operation with a strong filter expression.
B. Export the data to S3 and use Amazon Athena.
C. Create a Global Secondary Index (GSI) on the attribute you want to query.
D. Increase the table's provisioned read capacity.

Answer: C

Explanation: A Global Secondary Index (GSI) is the primary mechanism for enabling efficient queries on non-key attributes in DynamoDB. A GSI creates a copy of your data that is organized by a different primary key (the attributes you want to query on). This allows you to perform fast, efficient `Query` operations using these alternate keys instead of resorting to an inefficient full-table `Scan`.
---
Question #: 832
What is the primary difference between an RDS Read Replica and an RDS Multi-AZ deployment?

A. Read Replicas are for high availability, while Multi-AZ is for read scaling.
B. Read Replicas use synchronous replication, while Multi-AZ uses asynchronous replication.
C. A Read Replica can be promoted to a standalone master, while a Multi-AZ standby cannot be directly accessed and is only for failover.
D. Read Replicas must be in the same AZ as the primary, while Multi-AZ standby is in a different region.

Answer: C

Explanation: This highlights the key functional difference. A Read Replica is an accessible, read-only copy of the database with its own endpoint, and it has a defined process ("promotion") to become a new master. A Multi-AZ standby is a hidden, inaccessible copy whose sole purpose is to be a hot standby for an automatic, managed failover. Its existence is largely transparent to the user.
---
Question #: 833
An Aurora Serverless v2 database is configured with a minimum of 1 ACU and a maximum of 16 ACUs. The database is idle for several hours overnight. What will happen to its capacity?

A. It will remain at 16 ACUs to be ready for the next request.
B. It will scale down to 1 ACU to minimize costs.
C. It will scale down to 0 ACUs and shut down completely.
D. The capacity will fluctuate randomly between 1 and 16 ACUs.

Answer: B

Explanation: Aurora Serverless v2 is designed to automatically and granularly scale the compute and memory resources based on the application's real-time needs. When the workload is high, it will scale up towards the maximum. When the database is idle, it will scale down to the configured minimum capacity (in this case, 1 Aurora Capacity Unit or ACU) to reduce costs. It does not scale to zero like v1.

Question #: 834
A DynamoDB table is configured for On-Demand capacity. What does this mean for performance and billing?

A. You must specify the RCU and WCU values in advance, and you are billed for that capacity.
B. DynamoDB automatically scales the read and write capacity to meet the needs of the traffic, and you are billed per request.
C. The table can handle an unlimited number of requests per second.
D. The table's data is stored in a lower-cost, slower storage tier.

Answer: B

Explanation: On-Demand is the serverless capacity mode for DynamoDB. It eliminates the need for capacity planning. DynamoDB instantly allocates the required throughput as your application traffic ramps up or down. Your bill is based on the number of actual read and write requests your application performs, rather than on pre-provisioned capacity.

Question #: 835
You are using ElastiCache for Redis as a cache. The cache needs to store 500 GB of data and requires high availability. What is the best way to architect this?

A. Use a single, very large Redis node.
B. Use Redis in Cluster Mode Enabled, sharding the data across multiple nodes, with replicas for each shard in different AZs.
C. Use Memcached instead of Redis.
D. Use a Redis node and configure S3 as a backup.

Answer: B

Explanation: For a dataset that is too large for a single node's memory, or for workloads that require very high throughput, you should use Redis in Cluster Mode. This feature automatically shards your keyspace across multiple primary nodes, allowing you to scale horizontally. For high availability, you would configure replicas for each primary shard and distribute them across multiple Availability Zones.
---
Question #: 836
What is a DynamoDB "Local Secondary Index" (LSI)?

A. An index that uses the same partition key as the base table but a different sort key.
B. An index that uses a different partition key and a different sort key from the base table.
C. An index that is stored on the local disk of the DynamoDB server.
D. An index that can only be queried from within the same Availability Zone.

Answer: A

Explanation: An LSI provides an alternate sort order for the items within a single partition. It shares the same partition key as the main table, but you can define a different attribute to be the sort key. This allows you to perform efficient queries with different sorting criteria on the items that have the same partition key. LSIs must be created when the table is created.
---
Question #: 837
An application uses RDS Read Replicas to scale. During a period of very heavy write activity on the primary database, users report that the data they are reading from the replicas is noticeably out of date. What is the cause of this?

A. The Read Replicas have been stopped.
B. The application is connecting to the primary endpoint for reads.
C. "Replica lag" due to the asynchronous nature of the replication process.
D. The Multi-AZ failover process has been initiated.

Answer: C

Explanation: RDS Read Replicas use asynchronous replication. This means that writes are committed on the primary first, and then the changes are sent to the replicas to be applied. During periods of high write volume, it can take some time for these changes to be transmitted and applied on the replicas. This delay is known as "replica lag", and it means the data on the replica is temporarily inconsistent with the primary.
---
Question #: 838
Which of the following Aurora features allows a single database cluster to have up to 15 read replicas with very low replica lag (typically under 100 milliseconds)?

A. The shared storage architecture.
B. Aurora Parallel Query.
C. Aurora Global Database.
D. Aurora Serverless.

Answer: A

Explanation: Because all instances (writer and readers) in an Aurora cluster read from the same underlying shared storage volume, creating read replicas (Aurora Replicas) does not require replicating the data itself. The replicas simply read from the same data pages as the writer. The only thing that needs to be replicated is the stream of log records indicating changes, which is a much smaller amount of data. This allows for very low replica lag and the ability to have many replicas.
---
Question #: 839
A DynamoDB table has Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR) enabled. A developer accidentally deletes a critical item from the table. What is the process to recover the item?

A. Use the DynamoDB `UndeleteItem` API call.
B. Restore the table from the last daily backup.
C. Use PITR to restore the table to a new table from a specific point in time (just before the deletion), and then copy the item from the new table to the original table.
D. This is not possible; the item is permanently deleted.

Answer: C

Explanation: Point-in-Time Recovery allows you to restore your table to any point in time during the last 35 days with per-second precision. The restore process always creates a *new* table. To recover a single item, you would restore the table to a new name, retrieve the specific item from that newly restored table, and then write it back into your original production table.
---
Question #: 840
When should you choose Amazon DAX over ElastiCache for a DynamoDB caching layer?

A. When your application requires the advanced data structures of Redis.
B. When you want a cache that is fully managed and API-compatible with DynamoDB, requiring minimal application code changes.
C. When you need to cache data from an RDS database as well as DynamoDB.
D. When cost is the absolute most important factor.

Answer: B

Explanation: DAX's main selling point is its seamless integration with DynamoDB. Because it uses the same API calls, you can add a caching layer with very little effort. This is often faster to implement than a more general-purpose cache like ElastiCache, which would require your application to have explicit logic to check the cache first, then the database.
---
Question #: 841
What is an Aurora "fast database clone"?

A. A read replica that is created in less than a minute.
B. A feature that creates a new copy-on-write clone of an Aurora database cluster, typically in minutes, without copying the underlying data.
C. A point-in-time restore that completes in seconds.
D. A clone of the database that is stored in S3.

Answer: B

Explanation: Because Aurora's storage and compute are separate, it can perform a "clone" operation very quickly and efficiently. A fast clone creates a new cluster that points to the same underlying shared storage volume as the source cluster. It only starts to store new data when changes are made to either the source or the clone (a copy-on-write protocol). This makes it extremely fast and space-efficient to create copies for development, testing, or analysis.
---
Question #: 842
A DynamoDB table is configured with 50 WCUs. Your application needs to write a 10 KB item to the table. How many WCUs will this single write operation consume?

A. 1 WCU
B. 2.5 WCUs
C. 5 WCUs
D. 10 WCUs

Answer: D

Explanation: One Write Capacity Unit (WCU) represents one write per second for an item up to 1 KB in size. To calculate the WCUs for a larger item, you round the item size up to the nearest 1 KB. A 10 KB item would therefore require 10 WCUs for a single write.
---
Question #: 843
What is the primary purpose of the "reader endpoint" in an Aurora cluster?

A. To provide a single endpoint for all write operations.
B. To provide a connection endpoint that load balances read traffic across all available Aurora Replicas.
C. To connect to a specific Aurora Replica.
D. To provide access to the database's audit logs.

Answer: B

Explanation: The reader endpoint simplifies read scaling. Instead of your application needing to know the individual endpoints of all the replicas, it can simply connect to the single reader endpoint. Aurora will then automatically distribute the connections among the healthy replicas in the cluster.
---
Question #: 844
Which ElastiCache engine is multi-threaded, allowing it to better utilize multi-core EC2 instances for high-volume, simple get/set operations?

A. Redis
B. Memcached
C. Both are multi-threaded.
D. Neither are multi-threaded.

Answer: B

Explanation: A key architectural difference is that Redis is primarily single-threaded (for command processing), while Memcached is multi-threaded. This means that for simple key-value workloads, Memcached can often achieve higher throughput on a single node with multiple CPU cores because it can handle multiple requests concurrently on different threads.
---
Question #: 845
You have an RDS MySQL database with several read replicas. You need to apply a database schema change. What is the correct procedure?

A. Apply the change to all the read replicas first, and then to the primary.
B. Apply the change to the primary database instance. The change will then be automatically replicated to all the read replicas.
C. You must delete and recreate all the read replicas after applying the change to the primary.
D. Apply the change to the primary and one replica simultaneously.

Answer: B

Explanation: All changes, including both data (DML) and schema (DDL) modifications, must be made on the primary database instance. The replication mechanism will then automatically propagate these changes to all of the connected read replicas.
---
Question #: 846
An Aurora cluster is configured with a "custom endpoint". What is the use case for this feature?

A. To create an endpoint that provides access to the database from the public internet.
B. To create an endpoint that always connects to the primary instance.
C. To create an endpoint that groups a specific subset of replica instances, allowing you to direct certain queries to specific types of readers.
D. To create an endpoint that is shared across multiple AWS accounts.

Answer: C

Explanation: Custom endpoints provide more granular control over read traffic. For example, you might have some replicas that are a larger instance type, intended for analytical queries. You could create a custom endpoint that includes only these instances and direct your analytics application to connect to it, isolating that workload from your main application's read traffic.
---
Question #: 847
What is a DynamoDB Stream?

A. A feature for streaming video content stored in DynamoDB.
B. A time-ordered sequence of item-level changes (creations, updates, deletes) made to a DynamoDB table.
C. A continuous backup of a DynamoDB table.
D. A high-throughput connection for writing data to DynamoDB.

Answer: B

Explanation: A DynamoDB Stream is a change data capture (CDC) feature. When enabled, it captures a log of all modifications made to the items in your table. This stream can then be consumed by other services, most commonly AWS Lambda, to build powerful event-driven applications that react to data changes in near real-time.
---
Question #: 848
Which of the following is a managed, in-memory caching service?

A. Amazon S3
B. Amazon RDS
C. Amazon ElastiCache
D. Amazon EBS

Answer: C

Explanation: Amazon ElastiCache is the AWS service that provides fully managed, in-memory data stores and caches. It manages the setup, patching, and operation of Redis or Memcached clusters, allowing developers to focus on using the cache rather than managing it.
---
Question #: 849
A company needs to scale the read capacity of its main RDS database to serve traffic to a business intelligence (BI) application without impacting the performance of the primary production application. What should they do?

A. Enable Multi-AZ on the primary database.
B. Create a Read Replica and have the BI application connect to the replica's endpoint.
C. Increase the provisioned IOPS of the primary database's storage.
D. Use AWS Database Migration Service (DMS) to create a copy.

Answer: B

Explanation: This is a classic use case for Read Replicas. By creating a replica, you create an independent copy of the database that can be used to serve the demanding, long-running queries of the BI application. This isolates the BI workload and prevents it from consuming resources and impacting the performance of the primary database that serves the production application.
---
Question #: 850
Which Aurora feature allows you to run analytical queries against your transactional database without impacting the main workload by offloading the processing to the storage layer?

A. Aurora Serverless
B. Aurora Parallel Query
C. Aurora Global Database
D. Aurora Fast Cloning

Answer: B

Explanation: Aurora Parallel Query is an optimization that pushes down and parallelizes the processing of certain analytical queries directly into the Aurora storage layer. This can provide significant speedups for large queries without consuming CPU and memory resources on the database compute instances, thereby isolating analytical workloads from transactional ones.
---
Question #: 851
A DynamoDB table uses a simple primary key (a partition key only). What is the most efficient way to retrieve a single, specific item from the table?

A. Use a `Scan` operation with a filter for the partition key.
B. Use a `Query` operation specifying the partition key.
C. Use a `GetItem` operation specifying the partition key.
D. Create a Global Secondary Index and query it.

Answer: C

Explanation: The `GetItem` API call is the most efficient way to read a single item. It provides direct, low-latency access to an item based on its unique primary key. A `Query` (B) would also work but is designed for retrieving a range of items. A `Scan` (A) is the least efficient as it reads the entire table.
---
Question #: 852
You are choosing a caching engine for ElastiCache. Your application needs to support geospatial queries (e.g., "find all points of interest within 5 miles of a given coordinate"). Which engine should you choose?

A. Memcached
B. Redis
C. Both engines support geospatial queries.
D. Neither engine supports geospatial queries.

Answer: B

Explanation: Redis has built-in support for a wide variety of advanced data structures and commands, including a set of commands for handling geospatial data. You can add items with latitude/longitude coordinates to a sorted set and then perform radius queries on them, which Memcached cannot do.
---
Question #: 853
A DAX cluster has been deployed in front of a DynamoDB table. The application makes a write request for a new item. What is the flow of the request?

A. The application writes to DynamoDB, which then asynchronously updates DAX.
B. The application writes to DAX, which acknowledges the write and then asynchronously updates DynamoDB.
C. The application writes to DAX, which then synchronously writes the item to DynamoDB before acknowledging the write to the application (write-through).
D. The application must write to both DAX and DynamoDB in parallel.

Answer: C

Explanation: DAX is a write-through cache. When your application sends a write request (`PutItem`, `UpdateItem`, `DeleteItem`) to the DAX cluster, DAX forwards that request synchronously to the underlying DynamoDB table. Only after the write has been successfully committed in DynamoDB does DAX acknowledge the success back to the application. This ensures data consistency between the cache and the database.
---
Question #: 854
When would you choose to create a cross-region Read Replica for an RDS database?

A. To improve high availability within a single region.
B. To scale read traffic for users located within the same region as the primary.
C. To implement a low-RPO/RTO disaster recovery solution or to serve low-latency reads to users in a different geographic region.
D. When you need a synchronous copy of your database.

Answer: C

Explanation: Cross-region Read Replicas serve two main purposes. Their primary function is for disaster recovery; you can promote the replica in the event of a regional outage. Their secondary function is to reduce read latency for users in other parts of the world by placing a readable copy of the data closer to them.
---
Question #: 855
What is the writer instance in an Aurora database cluster?

A. It is the only instance in the cluster that can perform write operations (e.g., INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).
B. It is the instance with the most memory.
C. It is the instance that is responsible for writing backups to S3.
D. It is a special instance that only handles write traffic and cannot serve reads.

Answer: A

Explanation: In a standard Aurora cluster configuration, there is a single primary instance, also known as the writer instance. This is the only node that can accept data modification language (DML) statements. All other nodes in the cluster are read-only Aurora Replicas. The Cluster Endpoint always points to this writer instance.
---
Question #: 856
Which DynamoDB feature allows you to perform backups of terabyte-scale tables with no performance impact on the production table?

A. DynamoDB Streams
B. On-Demand Backups
C. Global Secondary Indexes
D. Provisioned Throughput

Answer: B

Explanation: DynamoDB On-Demand Backups are a key feature for data protection. When you initiate a backup, DynamoDB creates a full, consistent copy of your table without consuming any of your table's provisioned throughput. This means you can take backups at any time without worrying about impacting your application's performance. The same is true for Point-in-Time Recovery restores.
---
Question #: 857
You have a high-traffic web application that uses ElastiCache. You notice that the `CPUUtilization` of your cache nodes is very high. What is a common cause and solution?

A. The cache is too large; reduce the node size.
B. The cache is too small, leading to frequent evictions and re-fetching from the database; increase the node size or add more nodes.
C. The network connection is too slow; enable enhanced networking.
D. The database is too slow; create a read replica.

Answer: B

Explanation: A high CPU utilization on a cache node often indicates that the cache is "thrashing." This happens when the cache is too small to hold the working set of data. As a result, items are constantly being evicted to make room for new items, and the application experiences many cache misses, leading to a high rate of fetching from the database and writing back to the cache. The solution is to scale the cache up (larger node type) or out (more nodes).
---
Question #: 858
An Aurora cluster has one writer and three reader instances. The writer instance fails its health check. What is the expected behavior?

A. The entire cluster becomes unavailable until the writer is manually replaced.
B. One of the reader instances is automatically promoted to become the new writer, a process that typically takes less than 30 seconds.
C. The Reader Endpoint becomes the new writer endpoint.
D. The cluster becomes read-only.

Answer: B

Explanation: Aurora is designed for high availability. If the primary (writer) instance fails, Aurora's cluster manager will automatically detect the failure and promote one of the existing Aurora Replicas (readers) to be the new primary. The Cluster Endpoint DNS is updated to point to the newly promoted writer. This failover process is usually very fast.
---
Question #: 859
What is a DynamoDB "partition" in the context of performance?

A. A logical division of a table's data, based on the partition key, which is stored on a separate physical server.
B. A read replica of the table.
C. A secondary index.
D. A backup of the table.

Answer: A

Explanation: Under the hood, DynamoDB automatically partitions your table's data across multiple storage nodes. The partition key of an item is used to determine which partition that item belongs to. The table's total provisioned throughput is divided evenly among these partitions, so a well-designed partition key that distributes requests evenly is critical for performance.
---
Question #: 860
A social media application needs to store a graph of user relationships (who follows whom). The queries will involve finding friends of friends or identifying paths between users. Which database type is best suited for this workload?

A. A relational database like Amazon RDS.
B. A key-value database like Amazon DynamoDB.
C. A graph database like Amazon Neptune.
D. A document database like Amazon DocumentDB.

Answer: C

Explanation: While you can model relationships in other databases, a graph database is purpose-built for this type of workload. Amazon Neptune is a managed graph database service that is optimized for storing and querying highly connected data, making it easy and fast to run complex queries that explore relationships between data points.
---
Question #: 861
An RDS database is the source for a Read Replica. If you stop the primary RDS instance, what happens to the Read Replica?

A. The Read Replica is also stopped automatically.
B. The Read Replica continues to run, but replication is paused until the primary is started again.
C. The Read Replica is automatically promoted to be the new primary.
D. The Read Replica is terminated.

Answer: B

Explanation: Stopping the primary instance does not stop the replica. The replica remains active, but since its source is unavailable, the replication process is halted. You can still connect to the replica and run read queries against the data as it existed at the moment the primary was stopped. Replication will resume once the primary instance is started again.
---
Question #: 862
Which of the following is a primary benefit of using Aurora Serverless?

A. It provides the highest possible sustained performance for demanding workloads.
B. It automatically starts up, shuts down, and scales capacity based on your application's needs, making it ideal for intermittent or unpredictable workloads.
C. It allows you to have SSH access to the underlying database server.
D. It supports all database engines, including Oracle and SQL Server.

Answer: B

Explanation: The key value proposition of Aurora Serverless is its "on-demand" nature. It automatically scales compute resources up and down to match the active workload, and it can even scale down to zero when idle (for v1), making it extremely cost-effective for applications with infrequent, intermittent, or unpredictable traffic patterns, like development/test databases or internal tools.
---
Question #: 863
A company is using ElastiCache for Redis as a distributed cache. They need to scale their write performance horizontally. What feature of Redis allows for this?

A. Multi-AZ replication
B. Read Replicas
C. Cluster Mode with sharding
D. Snapshotting

Answer: C

Explanation: Redis Cluster Mode allows you to create a cluster of multiple primary nodes (a shard for each). The keyspace is partitioned across these shards. This means that write operations for different keys can be sent to different primary nodes in parallel, allowing you to scale the cluster's overall write throughput horizontally by adding more shards.
---
Question #: 864
A DynamoDB table has a Global Secondary Index (GSI). An application writes a new item to the base table. When is that item available to be queried in the GSI?

A. Immediately, as the write is synchronous to both the table and the GSI.
B. After a short delay, as the data is replicated asynchronously from the base table to the GSI.
C. Only after the next daily backup is complete.
D. After you manually trigger an update of the GSI.

Answer: B

Explanation: Replication from a DynamoDB base table to its GSIs is asynchronous. This means there is a small amount of replication lag, typically in the single-digit milliseconds. When you write to the table, the write is confirmed, and then the update is sent to the GSI. A query against the GSI immediately after a write might not see the new item until the replication is complete.
---
Question #: 865
What are the two main database engines supported by Amazon Aurora?

A. Oracle and SQL Server
B. MySQL and PostgreSQL
C. MongoDB and Cassandra
D. MariaDB and Db2

Answer: B

Explanation: Amazon Aurora is designed to be wire-compatible with two of the most popular open-source relational database engines: MySQL and PostgreSQL. This means you can often migrate applications from these databases to Aurora with minimal or no code changes.
---
Question #: 866
An application uses a DAX cluster. The application performs a strongly consistent read request. How does DAX handle this?

A. It returns the item from its cache if it exists.
B. It always bypasses the cache and passes the strongly consistent read request directly to DynamoDB.
C. It converts the request to an eventually consistent read.
D. It returns an error, as DAX does not support strongly consistent reads.

Answer: B

Explanation: DAX is designed as an eventually consistent read cache. It does not support strongly consistent reads. To ensure compatibility, when the DAX client receives a request that specifies a strongly consistent read, it doesn't even check its own cache. It simply passes the request straight through to the underlying DynamoDB table to be fulfilled.
---
Question #: 867
Which of the following is NOT a good use case for a relational database like Amazon RDS?

A. A financial application requiring ACID transactions.
B. A content management system with well-defined data schemas.
C. Storing and querying large, unstructured JSON documents with flexible schemas.
D. An e-commerce website's order and customer management system.

Answer: C

Explanation: Relational databases are built around a structured schema of tables and columns. While they can store JSON, they are not optimized for it. A NoSQL database like Amazon DynamoDB or a document database like Amazon DocumentDB is a much better fit for storing and querying semi-structured or unstructured data with a flexible schema.
---
Question #: 868
What is the purpose of a "cache cluster" in Amazon ElastiCache?

A. It is a single DNS endpoint for accessing the cache.
B. It is a collection of one or more cache nodes that run the Redis or Memcached engine.
C. It is a backup of the cache stored in S3.
D. It is a security group for the cache nodes.

Answer: B

Explanation: A cache cluster is the primary resource in ElastiCache. It represents the logical grouping of all the individual server instances (nodes) that you provision to run your caching engine. You can have a single-node cluster or a multi-node cluster for sharding and/or replication.
---
Question #: 869
You create an RDS MySQL instance with a 100 GiB General Purpose (gp2) EBS volume. What is the baseline IOPS performance of this volume?

A. 100 IOPS
B. 300 IOPS
C. 1000 IOPS
D. 3000 IOPS

Answer: B

Explanation: The older gp2 volume type provides a baseline performance of 3 IOPS for every 1 GiB of volume size. Therefore, a 100 GiB volume would have a baseline of 3 * 100 = 300 IOPS. It can also burst to a higher IOPS level for a limited time.
---
Question #: 870
An Aurora database cluster has a primary instance and five read replicas. What is the maximum number of replicas that can fail before the cluster's read availability is impacted?

A. 0
B. 1
C. 2
D. 5

Answer: D

Explanation: As long as at least one instance (either the primary or a replica) is available, the cluster can serve some form of traffic. If all five read replicas fail, the Reader Endpoint will have no healthy targets, so read availability would be impacted. However, the cluster would still be write-available via the Cluster Endpoint. The question asks about read availability, which would be impacted if all readers fail.
---
Question #: 871
Which DynamoDB feature allows you to query a table using a different partition key and sort key from the table's primary key?

A. A Local Secondary Index (LSI)
B. A Global Secondary Index (GSI)
C. DynamoDB Streams
D. A filter expression in a Scan operation.

Answer: B

Explanation: A Global Secondary Index is essentially a copy of your table (or a subset of its attributes) that is organized with a completely different primary key. This is the feature that allows you to create new, flexible query patterns on your data that were not supported by the original table's primary key.
---
Question #: 872
A company wants to implement a caching layer for their website. The primary goal is simplicity and ease of implementation. The cache will only store simple string data. Which ElastiCache engine is generally simpler to use?

A. Redis
B. Memcached
C. Both have the same level of complexity.
D. Neither is suitable for simple string data.

Answer: B

Explanation: Memcached has a simpler data model (key-value strings only) and a smaller set of commands compared to the feature-rich Redis engine. This makes it a very simple and straightforward choice for use cases that only require a basic object cache.
---
Question #: 873
What is the minimum number of copies of your data that Amazon Aurora stores?

A. 2 copies in 2 Availability Zones
B. 3 copies in 3 Availability Zones
C. 4 copies in 2 Availability Zones
D. 6 copies in 3 Availability Zones

Answer: D

Explanation: To provide extremely high durability and availability, the Aurora storage engine automatically creates 6 copies of your data and distributes them across 3 Availability Zones (two copies per AZ).
---
Question #: 874
When an RDS Read Replica is created, what is the initial state of its data?

A. It starts as an empty database and slowly catches up.
B. It is created from a snapshot of the primary database taken at the moment the replica creation is initiated.
C. It is an exact, real-time copy of the primary from the very first second.
D. You must manually load data into the replica.

Answer: B

Explanation: The process of creating a Read Replica begins with RDS automatically taking a snapshot of your source instance. The new replica instance is then created and its volume is seeded with the data from this snapshot. After that, it connects to the primary and begins the ongoing asynchronous replication process to catch up on any changes made since the snapshot was taken.
---
Question #: 875
What is a write-through cache?

A. A cache where data is only written to the cache, and not the database.
B. A cache where the application writes data to the database, which then updates the cache.
C. A cache where the application writes to the cache first, which then synchronously writes to the database.
D. A cache that does not support write operations.

Answer: C

Explanation: In a write-through cache pattern, the application treats the cache as the primary data store for writes. It writes the data to the cache, and the cache itself is responsible for synchronously writing that same data to the backend database. This ensures consistency but adds latency to write operations. DAX is an example of a write-through cache.
---
Question #: 876
What is a key benefit of using DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) for read-heavy workloads?

A. It provides strongly consistent reads.
B. It can reduce read latency from milliseconds to microseconds.
C. It reduces the cost of write operations.
D. It can be used with any database engine, not just DynamoDB.

Answer: B

Explanation: The primary benefit of DAX is a dramatic improvement in read performance. By serving frequently accessed items from its in-memory cache, DAX can deliver responses in microseconds. This is a significant improvement over the already fast single-digit millisecond latency provided by DynamoDB itself.
---
Question #: 877
Which of the following is a managed NoSQL database service on AWS?

A. Amazon RDS
B. Amazon Aurora
C. Amazon DynamoDB
D. Amazon Redshift

Answer: C

Explanation: Amazon DynamoDB is AWS's flagship fully managed NoSQL database service. It supports both key-value and document data models. RDS and Aurora are relational (SQL) databases, and Redshift is a data warehouse.
---
Question #: 878
You have an application that requires an in-memory database with high availability and the ability to shard data across multiple nodes to handle a very large dataset. Which service and configuration is the best fit?

A. Amazon DynamoDB with a GSI.
B. Amazon ElastiCache for Memcached.
C. Amazon RDS with Multi-AZ.
D. Amazon ElastiCache for Redis in Cluster Mode.

Answer: D

Explanation: Redis Cluster Mode is the feature that allows you to horizontally scale a Redis workload. It automatically partitions (shards) your keyspace across multiple primary nodes. This allows you to store a dataset that is larger than the memory of a single node and to scale write throughput by adding more shards. You can also configure replicas for each shard to provide high availability.
---
Question #: 879
What is the primary use case for an RDS Read Replica?

A. To improve the write performance of a database.
B. To provide a synchronous standby for disaster recovery.
C. To scale out the read performance of a database and offload read-heavy workloads.
D. To provide a backup of the database.

Answer: C

Explanation: The main purpose of a Read Replica is to improve performance by scaling the read capacity of your database. By directing read queries to one or more replicas, you can significantly reduce the load on the primary instance, allowing it to dedicate its resources to handling write operations.
---
Question #: 880
Which Aurora feature provides a way to quickly create a new copy of a database for testing or development purposes without duplicating the storage?

A. Backtrack
B. Fast Database Cloning
C. Snapshots
D. Read Replicas

Answer: B

Explanation: Fast Database Cloning uses a copy-on-write protocol. When you clone a database, the new cluster simply points to the same underlying storage volume as the original. Data is only physically duplicated when a change is made to either the source or the clone. This makes the cloning process extremely fast (minutes) and space-efficient.

Question #: 881
A DynamoDB `Query` operation on a 100 GB table returns 100 KB of data. How is the cost of this operation calculated in Provisioned Capacity mode?

A. Based on the total size of the table (100 GB).
B. Based on the total size of the items that were read to find the result, not just the size of the data returned.
C. Based on the size of the data that is returned to the client (100 KB).
D. The cost is fixed per query, regardless of the data size.

Answer: B

Explanation: The cost of a DynamoDB `Query` or `Scan` is based on the total amount of data that DynamoDB has to read from disk to process your request, even if you use a filter to reduce the amount of data returned to your application. This is why efficient queries using indexes are so important for managing costs.

Question #: 882
A web application uses an RDS database. During peak hours, the database CPU is at 100%, and users are experiencing slow response times. The majority of the queries are complex `SELECT` statements. What is the most effective first step to mitigate this issue?

A. Create a Read Replica and direct the `SELECT` queries to it.
B. Enable Multi-AZ on the database.
C. Switch the database to use On-Demand capacity.
D. Increase the size of the EBS volume.

Answer: A

Explanation: High CPU caused by read queries is a classic indicator that the database needs to be scaled for reads. The most direct and scalable solution is to create a Read Replica. This will create a separate database instance dedicated to handling the read traffic, immediately offloading the primary instance and reducing its CPU utilization.

Question #: 883
Which of the following database services is "serverless," meaning you do not need to manage any database instances or clusters? (Choose TWO)

A. Amazon RDS
B. Amazon Aurora Serverless
C. Amazon DynamoDB
D. Amazon ElastiCache
E. A self-managed database on EC2

Answer: B, C

Explanation: "Serverless" means you don't manage the underlying compute infrastructure. DynamoDB (C) is fully serverless by design. Aurora Serverless (B) is a configuration of Aurora that automatically starts, stops, and scales the compute capacity for you, providing a serverless experience for a relational database.
---
Question #: 884
What is the primary difference in consistency between a DynamoDB Global Secondary Index (GSI) and a Local Secondary Index (LSI)?

A. GSIs are strongly consistent, while LSIs are eventually consistent.
B. GSIs are eventually consistent, while LSIs can be configured for either strong or eventual consistency.
C. Both are always strongly consistent.
D. Both are always eventually consistent.

Answer: B

Explanation: Because an LSI shares the same partition key (and underlying partition) as the base table, DynamoDB can offer the option to perform strongly consistent reads against it. A GSI has a different partition key and is stored in its own separate partition; the replication from the base table to the GSI is always asynchronous, meaning all reads from a GSI are eventually consistent.
---
Question #: 885
An Aurora cluster has one writer and several replicas. The writer instance is a large `db.r6g.4xlarge`. The replicas are small `db.r6g.large` instances. What is this configuration useful for?

A. It is not a valid configuration.
B. It is useful when the read and write workloads have different performance requirements, allowing you to size the instances appropriately.
C. It improves the write performance of the cluster.
D. It is the standard configuration for a Global Database.

Answer: B

Explanation: Aurora allows you to have instances of different sizes within the same cluster. This is useful for cost optimization. You can have a large, powerful writer instance to handle the write load, and then size your read replicas based on the intensity of your read traffic, using smaller instances if the read load is light.
---
Question #: 886
What is the "Time to Live (TTL)" setting in a caching context, such as in ElastiCache or DAX?

A. The time it takes for a write to be persisted to the database.
B. A value that specifies how long an item should remain in the cache before it is considered expired and is evicted.
C. The network latency between the application and the cache cluster.
D. The amount of time the cache can operate before it needs to be restarted.

Answer: B

Explanation: TTL is a critical part of cache management. It is a value (in seconds) that you set on a cached item. After that amount of time has passed, the cache will automatically evict the item. This ensures that stale data does not remain in the cache indefinitely and forces the application to re-fetch a fresh copy from the source of truth.
---
Question #: 887
You are creating an RDS for Oracle database and need the highest level of availability and protection against a full Availability Zone failure. What feature should you enable?

A. Read Replicas
B. Cross-Region Replication
C. Enhanced Monitoring
D. Multi-AZ Deployment

Answer: D

Explanation: Multi-AZ is the primary feature for in-region high availability. It provides a fully managed, synchronous standby replica in a different AZ. In the event of an infrastructure failure in the primary AZ, RDS will automatically fail over to the standby, providing a highly resilient database environment.
---
Question #: 888
A DynamoDB table stores IoT sensor data. The partition key is `SensorID` and the sort key is `Timestamp`. You need to retrieve all the data for a specific sensor for the last 24 hours. Which API call should you use?

A. `GetItem`
B. `Scan` with a filter expression.
C. `BatchGetItem`
D. `Query` with a key condition expression on `Timestamp`.

Answer: D

Explanation: This is a perfect use case for a `Query` operation. You would specify the exact `SensorID` as the partition key. Then, you would use a key condition expression on the `Timestamp` sort key to specify a range, such as `Timestamp > (now - 24 hours)`. This will efficiently retrieve only the requested items from that specific partition.
---
Question #: 889
What is the maximum number of Read Replicas you can create for a standard Amazon RDS for MySQL database?

A. 1
B. 5
C. 15
D. There is no hard limit.

Answer: B

Explanation: For standard RDS database engines like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MariaDB, you can create up to 5 Read Replicas from a single source database instance. (Note: For Aurora, this limit is higher at 15).
---
Question #: 890
Which of the following statements is true about Amazon Aurora?

A. It is a NoSQL database service.
B. It is compatible with both MySQL and PostgreSQL database engines.
C. It requires you to manage database patching and backups manually.
D. It can only be deployed in a single Availability Zone.

Answer: B

Explanation: Amazon Aurora is a relational database engine that AWS built to be compatible with the open-source MySQL and PostgreSQL databases. This allows for easy migration of applications that use these popular engines. It is a fully managed service (C is false) and is multi-AZ by design (D is false).
---
Question #: 891
An application needs to store and retrieve user profile objects as JSON documents. The schema for the profiles may change over time. Which AWS database service is a good fit for this use case?

A. Amazon RDS for SQL Server
B. Amazon ElastiCache
C. Amazon DynamoDB
D. Amazon Redshift

Answer: C

Explanation: DynamoDB is a NoSQL database that excels at storing semi-structured data like JSON documents. Its schemaless nature means you can have items in the same table with different attributes, which is perfect for a use case like user profiles where you might add new attributes over time without needing to perform complex schema migrations.
---
Question #: 892
You are using ElastiCache for Redis. You want to ensure that if a node fails, the data is not lost. What feature must be enabled?

A. Multi-threading
B. Sharding
C. Persistence (using AOF or RDB snapshots)
D. A high TTL value

Answer: C

Explanation: By default, Redis is a purely in-memory data store. If the node reboots or fails, all data is lost. To make it durable, you must enable one of Redis's persistence options. RDB creates point-in-time snapshots of your dataset, and AOF (Append Only File) logs every write operation. These can be used to restore the data after a restart.
---
Question #: 893
What is the primary benefit of the separation of compute and storage in the Amazon Aurora architecture?

A. It reduces the cost of database licensing.
B. It allows for faster database operations like cloning, snapshots, and failover, and enables more efficient scaling of read replicas.
C. It allows you to use any type of EBS volume for the storage layer.
D. It simplifies the process of connecting to the database.

Answer: B

Explanation: The decoupled architecture is the source of many of Aurora's key advantages. Because storage is a separate, shared layer, operations that would be slow in a traditional database become very fast. A failover is fast because the standby doesn't need to copy data. Cloning is fast because it's just a metadata operation. Adding a read replica is fast because it just needs to connect to the existing storage volume.
---
Question #: 894
You are designing a DynamoDB table and need to choose a partition key. The application will have a very high volume of writes from many different sources. What is the most important characteristic of a good partition key?

A. It should be a timestamp.
B. It should be a value that is the same for most items.
C. It should be a value that has high cardinality and will distribute the I/O requests evenly across all partitions.
D. It should be an incrementing number.

Answer: C

Explanation: A well-designed partition key is critical for DynamoDB performance. To avoid creating "hot partitions" (where all the traffic goes to a single underlying storage node), you should choose a partition key with high cardinality (many distinct values). This ensures that your items, and the read/write traffic for them, are spread uniformly across all the available partitions, allowing the table to scale effectively.
---
Question #: 895
An RDS database is running low on storage space. What is the process to increase the size of its EBS volume?

A. You must create a snapshot and restore it to a new, larger instance.
B. You can modify the running RDS instance and increase the allocated storage size, often with no downtime.
C. You must detach the volume, resize it, and re-attach it.
D. You must create a read replica with a larger volume and then promote it.

Answer: B

Explanation: Amazon RDS supports online storage scaling for most database engines and volume types. You can go into the modify settings for your RDS instance, specify a new, larger storage size, and apply the change. For most scenarios, RDS can perform this storage modification without requiring any downtime for your database.
---
Question #: 896
Which of the following is a primary use case for Amazon ElastiCache?

A. Serving as a primary transactional database.
B. Long-term archival of data.
C. Providing an in-memory cache to reduce latency and database load for frequently accessed data.
D. Storing large binary files like images and videos.

Answer: C

Explanation: ElastiCache is an in-memory data store. Its main purpose is to act as a caching layer. By storing copies of frequently read data in the high-speed cache, applications can avoid making slower, more expensive calls to the primary database, which results in lower latency and improved overall application performance.
---
Question #: 897
What is a key difference between Aurora Serverless v1 and v2?

A. v1 scales in finer-grained increments than v2.
B. v2 can scale down to zero capacity, while v1 cannot.
C. v2 scales almost instantly without a disruption to connections, while v1 had a noticeable pause for scaling.
D. v1 supports PostgreSQL, while v2 only supports MySQL.

Answer: C

Explanation: A major improvement in Aurora Serverless v2 is its scaling mechanism. v2 can scale up and down in very fine-grained increments without dropping database connections, making the scaling process nearly transparent to the application. v1, on the other hand, had to find a quiet point to perform a scaling operation, which could take some time and cause a brief pause in processing.
---
Question #: 898
An application reads the same small set of configuration data from a DynamoDB table at the start of every transaction. This is creating a "hot spot" on a single item and consuming a lot of read capacity. What is the most effective solution?

A. Increase the provisioned read capacity of the table.
B. Cache the configuration data in the application memory or in a dedicated caching service like ElastiCache.
C. Create a Global Secondary Index on the configuration data.
D. Switch the table to On-Demand capacity mode.

Answer: B

Explanation: This is a classic caching use case. Since the data is read frequently and changes infrequently, it's inefficient to fetch it from DynamoDB every time. The best solution is to read the data once and cache it. This could be done within the application's local memory or, for a distributed application, in a shared cache like Amazon ElastiCache. This will dramatically reduce the read load on the DynamoDB table.
---
Question #: 899
A company is launching a new web application with a global user base. They want to provide the lowest possible latency for serving static content like images, videos, and CSS files. Which AWS service is BEST suited for this requirement?

A. AWS Global Accelerator
B. Amazon CloudFront
C. An Application Load Balancer with Cross-Zone Load Balancing
D. S3 Transfer Acceleration

Answer: B

Explanation: Amazon CloudFront is a Content Delivery Network (CDN) specifically designed to cache static and dynamic content at edge locations around the world, closer to end-users. This significantly reduces latency for content delivery. Global Accelerator (A) is for improving the performance of the transport path for applications, not for caching. S3 Transfer Acceleration (D) is for speeding up uploads to S3, not for delivering content from it.
---
Question #: 900
An application running on EC2 instances behind a Network Load Balancer (NLB) needs to be accessible to a global user base with minimal latency and jitter for TCP traffic. The application also requires a static IP address to be whitelisted by clients. Which service should be used?

A. Amazon CloudFront
B. AWS Global Accelerator
C. A VPC Peering connection to each client's VPC.
D. An Elastic IP address on the NLB.

Answer: B

Explanation: AWS Global Accelerator is the ideal service for this use case. It provides two static Anycast IP addresses and routes traffic over the highly reliable and performant AWS global network, which reduces latency and jitter for TCP/UDP traffic. It can use an NLB as an endpoint. CloudFront (A) is primarily for caching HTTP/S content.
---
Question #: 901
A company has two VPCs, VPC-A and VPC-B, in the same region. They need to enable communication between instances in these VPCs using private IP addresses. They have set up a VPC Peering connection, and the status is "active". However, the instances still cannot communicate. What is the most likely missing step?

A. Enabling DNS resolution on the peering connection.
B. Updating the route tables in each VPC to direct traffic destined for the other VPC to the peering connection.
C. Attaching an Internet Gateway to each VPC.
D. Creating a NAT Gateway in each VPC.

Answer: B

Explanation: Creating and accepting a VPC Peering connection is only the first step. For traffic to flow, you must explicitly update the route table in each VPC. VPC-A's route table needs a route with VPC-B's CIDR block as the destination and the peering connection ID as the target, and vice-versa for VPC-B's route table.
---
Question #: 902
An organization has over 50 VPCs in a single region. They need to establish full interconnectivity between all of them. What is the most scalable and manageable solution to achieve this?

A. Create a full mesh of VPC Peering connections between all 50 VPCs.
B. Use AWS Direct Connect to link all the VPCs.
C. Deploy an AWS Transit Gateway and connect all VPCs to it.
D. Create a single, large "shared services" VPC and peer it with all other VPCs.

Answer: C

Explanation: A full mesh of VPC Peering connections becomes extremely complex and difficult to manage at scale (requiring nearly 1225 peering connections for 50 VPCs). AWS Transit Gateway is designed to solve this problem by acting as a central "hub" or cloud router. Each VPC connects to the Transit Gateway, which simplifies the network architecture into a manageable hub-and-spoke model.
---
Question #: 903
A CloudFront distribution is configured to serve content from an S3 bucket. You want to prevent users from accessing the content directly via the S3 URL, forcing them to use the CloudFront URL instead. What should you configure?

A. A CloudFront security policy.
B. An S3 bucket policy that denies access unless the request comes from a specific IP range.
C. A CloudFront Origin Access Identity (OAI) or Origin Access Control (OAC) and an S3 bucket policy that only allows access to that identity.
D. S3 Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS).

Answer: C

Explanation: The standard and secure method to achieve this is by using OAI (legacy) or the newer OAC. This creates a special CloudFront identity that you can reference in your S3 bucket policy. The policy is configured to only allow `s3:GetObject` requests from this specific CloudFront identity, effectively blocking all direct access to the S3 bucket.
---
Question #: 904
What is a key difference between AWS Global Accelerator and Amazon CloudFront?

A. CloudFront uses static IP addresses, while Global Accelerator uses a unique DNS name.
B. CloudFront is for caching content at the edge, while Global Accelerator optimizes the network path from the user to the application endpoint.
C. CloudFront can only have S3 buckets as an origin, while Global Accelerator can have EC2 instances.
D. Global Accelerator is a regional service, while CloudFront is global.

Answer: B

Explanation: This is the fundamental distinction. CloudFront is a CDN that caches content close to users to reduce latency. Global Accelerator does not cache content; instead, it uses the AWS global network and Anycast IPs to find the optimal path for user traffic back to your application, improving performance for stateful, non-cacheable workloads.
---
Question #: 905
You have three VPCs: VPC-A is peered with VPC-B, and VPC-B is peered with VPC-C. Can an instance in VPC-A communicate directly with an instance in VPC-C through this configuration?

A. Yes, because the peering connections form a chain.
B. No, because VPC Peering is not transitive.
C. Yes, but only if DNS resolution is enabled on both peering connections.
D. No, because the CIDR blocks will overlap.

Answer: B

Explanation: A core limitation of VPC Peering is that it does not support transitive routing. This means that if A is peered with B, and B is peered with C, there is no automatic path between A and C. To enable that communication, you would need to create a separate, direct peering connection between VPC-A and VPC-C.
---
Question #: 906
A company connects its on-premises data center to a Transit Gateway via a Direct Connect connection. It also connects 10 VPCs to the same Transit Gateway. What does this configuration enable?

A. It allows the on-premises network to communicate with all 10 VPCs through a single connection.
B. It allows the 10 VPCs to communicate with each other, but not with the on-premises network.
C. It encrypts all traffic between the VPCs by default.
D. It allows the on-premises network to access the public internet through the VPCs.

Answer: A

Explanation: An AWS Transit Gateway acts as a central router. By attaching both the Direct Connect gateway (for the on-premises connection) and the 10 VPCs to the Transit Gateway, and configuring the route tables appropriately, you create a hub-and-spoke network. This allows any attachment to communicate with any other attachment, meaning the on-premises network can reach all 10 VPCs through that single hub.
---
Question #: 907
A CloudFront distribution is configured with a default TTL of 24 hours. A new version of an image file is uploaded to the S3 origin, replacing the old one. However, users are still seeing the old image. What is the fastest way to force CloudFront to serve the new image to all users?

A. Wait for the 24-hour TTL to expire.
B. Create a new CloudFront distribution.
C. Create a CloudFront invalidation for the image file's path (e.g., `/images/logo.png`).
D. Update the bucket policy on the S3 origin.

Answer: C

Explanation: A CloudFront invalidation is a request you can make to force CloudFront to evict an object from its edge caches before the TTL expires. When you invalidate an object's path, the next time a user requests that object, CloudFront will miss the cache and go back to the origin to fetch the new version.
---
Question #: 908
Which of the following is a good use case for AWS Global Accelerator?

A. Serving a static website with low latency to a global audience.
B. A real-time multiplayer gaming application that requires low latency and jitter for UDP traffic.
C. Storing and serving large video files.
D. A batch processing job that runs nightly in a single region.

Answer: B

Explanation: Global Accelerator is ideal for latency-sensitive, non-HTTP, or stateful applications like gaming, VoIP, and IoT. It optimizes the network path over the AWS backbone for TCP and UDP traffic, which is critical for real-time applications where caching (like in CloudFront) is not possible.
---
Question #: 909
You have a VPC peering connection between VPC-A in your AWS account and VPC-B in another AWS account. You want to allow an EC2 instance in VPC-A to access a database in VPC-B. What is a best practice for configuring the database's security group?

A. Allow traffic on the database port from the public IP address of the EC2 instance in VPC-A.
B. Allow traffic on the database port from the entire CIDR block of VPC-A.
C. Allow traffic on the database port by referencing the Security Group ID of the EC2 instance in VPC-A.
D. Allow traffic on the database port from 0.0.0.0/0.

Answer: B

Explanation: While you can reference a Security Group ID from a peered VPC (C), this requires the VPC owner to know and trust a specific SG ID. A more common and secure pattern than allowing the world (D) is to allow traffic from the entire private CIDR block of the peered VPC (B). This ensures that only resources within that specific trusted VPC can access the database. Note: referencing a peered SG ID is also a valid and often more specific approach if the accounts coordinate.
*Correction:* Referencing the Security Group ID of the peered instance is actually more secure and flexible than using a CIDR block, as it doesn't depend on the instance's IP address. This is a supported feature for peered VPCs.

Answer: C

Explanation: For peered VPCs (even across accounts), you can reference a security group from the peer VPC in your security group rules. This is the most secure and flexible method because it ties the access rule to the specific instance(s) that have that security group, rather than their IP addresses (which can change) or the entire subnet's CIDR block (which might be too permissive).
---
Question #: 910
How does AWS Transit Gateway handle routing between its attachments?

A. All attachments can communicate with each other by default.
B. It uses a central route table that can be associated with attachments, and routes can be propagated from attachments to this table.
C. It relies on VPC Peering for all inter-VPC communication.
D. It uses Security Groups to control routing.

Answer: B

Explanation: Routing within a Transit Gateway is controlled by Transit Gateway Route Tables. Each attachment is associated with one route table. This route table determines where traffic from that attachment can be routed. Routes can be added statically or dynamically propagated from the VPC and VPN attachments, giving you granular control over the network topology.
---
Question #: 911
You want to serve private content from a CloudFront distribution to a specific set of paid users. What feature should you use to restrict access?

A. An Origin Access Identity (OAI).
B. AWS WAF with a rate-based rule.
C. CloudFront Signed URLs or Signed Cookies.
D. A security policy with TLSv1.3.

Answer: C

Explanation: Signed URLs and Signed Cookies are the features designed for this use case. Your application can generate a temporary, signed URL or cookie for an authenticated user. This signed token grants the user time-limited access to a specific piece of private content through CloudFront. OAI (A) is for restricting access to the origin, not controlling which end-users can access the content via CloudFront.
---
Question #: 912
What is the primary benefit of using AWS Global Accelerator for an application that uses an Application Load Balancer as an endpoint?

A. It allows the ALB to cache static content.
B. It provides a pair of static Anycast IP addresses for the application and routes traffic over the optimized AWS global network.
C. It encrypts the traffic between the user and the ALB.
D. It allows the ALB to be deployed across multiple regions.

Answer: B

Explanation: While an ALB provides a regional DNS name, Global Accelerator provides stable, static IP addresses that act as a fixed entry point. It then ingresses user traffic at the nearest AWS edge location and carries it across the AWS private backbone to your ALB, avoiding the potential congestion and variability of the public internet.
---
Question #: 913
Which of the following statements about VPC Peering is TRUE?

A. VPC Peering supports transitive routing.
B. You can create a peering connection between VPCs with overlapping CIDR blocks.
C. You can reference a security group from a peered VPC in a security group rule.
D. VPC Peering traffic is routed over the public internet by default.

Answer: C

Explanation: A key feature for building secure multi-VPC architectures is the ability to reference a security group from a peered VPC in a security group rule. This allows you to create specific firewall rules without relying on static CIDR blocks. VPC Peering is not transitive (A), does not support overlapping CIDRs (B), and traffic always stays on the private AWS backbone (D).
---
Question #: 914
A company has a central "shared services" VPC and multiple "application" VPCs. They want all traffic from the application VPCs to the internet to be filtered through a central firewall appliance located in the shared services VPC. Which service enables this "egress VPC" pattern?

A. VPC Peering
B. AWS Global Accelerator
C. AWS Transit Gateway
D. AWS Direct Connect

Answer: C

Explanation: AWS Transit Gateway is the ideal service for creating centralized network architectures. You can configure the route tables in the application VPCs to send all default traffic (0.0.0.0/0) to the Transit Gateway. The Transit Gateway's route table can then direct this traffic to an attachment in the shared services VPC, where it can be inspected by a firewall before being sent out to the internet via a NAT Gateway.
---
Question #: 915
A user in Europe is accessing a website hosted in a single AWS region in North America. The website's dynamic content is loading slowly. How can CloudFront be used to improve the performance of this dynamic content?

A. CloudFront cannot improve the performance of dynamic content.
B. By caching the dynamic content at the edge for a very long TTL.
C. By terminating the user's TCP and TLS connection at a nearby edge location and then using an optimized, persistent connection back to the origin over the AWS network.
D. By using Lambda@Edge to generate the content at the edge.

Answer: C

Explanation: While CloudFront is known for caching, it also significantly improves the performance of dynamic content. It does this by establishing a TCP/TLS connection with the user from a nearby, low-latency edge location. It then forwards the request back to the origin over the highly optimized and persistent connections of the AWS global network. This avoids the multiple round trips over the public internet that would otherwise be required for the TCP handshake and TLS negotiation.
---
Question #: 916
You are using AWS Global Accelerator and have configured two endpoint groups in two different AWS regions. You have configured health checks for the endpoints in both regions. The primary region fails its health check. What happens?

A. Global Accelerator stops responding to requests.
B. Global Accelerator returns a DNS failure.
C. Global Accelerator automatically redirects all traffic to the healthy endpoints in the second region.
D. You must manually update the Global Accelerator configuration to fail over.

Answer: C

Explanation: AWS Global Accelerator has built-in, automatic failover capabilities. It continuously monitors the health of its configured endpoints. If it detects that all endpoints in one region are unhealthy, it will instantly and automatically reroute all user traffic to the healthy endpoints in the next available region, with no DNS changes required.
---
Question #: 917
When can two VPCs NOT be peered?

A. If they are in different AWS accounts.
B. If they are in different AWS regions.
C. If they have overlapping or matching CIDR blocks.
D. If they do not have an Internet Gateway.

Answer: C

Explanation: A fundamental requirement for VPC Peering is that the two VPCs must have distinct, non-overlapping IPv4 CIDR blocks. If the CIDR blocks overlap, the routing would be ambiguous, so AWS does not allow a peering connection to be established in this case.
---
Question #: 918
What is a "Transit Gateway attachment"?

A. An IAM role that allows access to the Transit Gateway.
B. The connection between the Transit Gateway and a network resource, such as a VPC, a VPN connection, or a Direct Connect gateway.
C. A security group for the Transit Gateway.
D. A DNS record for the Transit Gateway.

Answer: B

Explanation: An attachment is the object that represents the connection of a network to the Transit Gateway. You can create attachments for your VPCs, for your Site-to-Site VPN connections, and for your Direct Connect gateways. These attachments are what allow the resources to send and receive traffic through the Transit Gateway.
---
Question #: 919
A CloudFront distribution is configured with multiple cache behaviors. There is a path-based rule for `/images/*` and a default behavior for `*`. A user requests `/images/cat.jpg`. Which cache behavior will be used?

A. The default behavior (`*`).
B. The `/images/*` behavior.
C. Both behaviors will be merged.
D. The behavior with the lowest TTL.

Answer: B

Explanation: CloudFront evaluates cache behaviors in a specific order. It first checks for matches based on path patterns, from most specific to least specific. Since `/images/cat.jpg` is a more specific match for the `/images/*` pattern than for the default `*` pattern, the `/images/*` cache behavior will be used to handle the request.
---
Question #: 920
A gaming company has a session-based multiplayer game. They need to ensure that once a user connects to a game server in a specific region, all subsequent packets for that session are consistently routed to the same server. Which Global Accelerator feature helps with this?

A. Endpoint weights
B. Health checks
C. Client affinity (source IP)
D. Anycast IPs

Answer: C

Explanation: Client affinity, also known as session stickiness, is a feature of Global Accelerator listeners. When you enable client affinity based on the source IP, Global Accelerator will consistently route all requests from a given client's IP address to the same endpoint for the duration of their session. This is critical for stateful applications like games.
---
Question #: 921
You have set up a VPC Peering connection between VPC-A and VPC-B. You have updated the route tables. Now you need to configure the firewall rules. Which of the following is true?

A. Security Groups can be configured to allow traffic from the peered VPC's CIDR block.
B. Network ACLs can be configured to allow traffic from the peered VPC's Security Group ID.
C. All traffic between peered VPCs is allowed by default.
D. Security Groups in one VPC cannot be referenced by the other.

Answer: A

Explanation: To allow traffic to flow, you must update the firewall rules. For Security Groups, you can add a rule that allows traffic from the source CIDR block of the peered VPC. For Network ACLs, you would also add rules allowing traffic to and from the peered VPC's CIDR block. NACLs (B) cannot reference Security Group IDs.
---
Question #: 922
In an AWS Transit Gateway, what is the function of "route propagation"?

A. It allows the Transit Gateway to automatically learn the routes from the attached VPCs and VPNs and add them to its route table.
B. It advertises the Transit Gateway's routes to on-premises networks.
C. It allows you to manually create static routes in the Transit Gateway.
D. It propagates DNS entries between VPCs.

Answer: A

Explanation: Route propagation simplifies route management. When you associate a VPC with a Transit Gateway route table and enable propagation, the Transit Gateway automatically learns the CIDR block of that VPC and adds a route for it to the route table. This means you don't have to manually create static routes for every VPC you attach.

Question #: 923
You are serving a web application from an ALB origin via CloudFront. You want to forward a custom HTTP header named `X-User-ID` from the client to your origin server. What must you configure in CloudFront?

A. A CloudFront Function to add the header.
B. A custom security policy.
C. A cache policy (or legacy cache settings) that is configured to forward the `X-User-ID` header as part of the cache key.
D. An Origin Access Identity (OAI).

Answer: C

Explanation: By default, CloudFront does not forward most HTTP headers to the origin to maximize cacheability. To pass a custom header through, you must explicitly configure your cache behavior to include it. You would modify the cache policy to add the `X-User-ID` header to the list of headers that are forwarded to the origin and included in the cache key.

Question #: 924
What is the primary benefit of using an Elastic Network Adapter (ENA) for enhanced networking on an EC2 instance?

A. It provides a static private IP address.
B. It provides significantly higher packet-per-second (PPS) performance, lower latency, and lower jitter compared to older network interfaces.
C. It allows the instance to attach to multiple VPCs.
D. It encrypts all network traffic automatically.

Answer: B

Explanation: ENA is the underlying technology for enhanced networking on modern EC2 instances. It uses single root I/O virtualization (SR-IOV) to provide a high-performance network interface, which is critical for network-intensive applications that need to process a large number of packets or are sensitive to latency variations (jitter).

Question #: 925
You need to establish a dedicated, private, high-bandwidth network connection from your on-premises data center to AWS. The connection must not traverse the public internet. Which service should you use?

A. AWS Site-to-Site VPN
B. AWS Global Accelerator
C. AWS Direct Connect
D. VPC Peering

Answer: C

Explanation: AWS Direct Connect is the service that provides a dedicated, private physical connection between your on-premises network and an AWS Direct Connect location. This offers a more consistent, reliable, and often higher-bandwidth experience than an internet-based VPN connection (A).
---
Question #: 926
Which of the following is a limitation of AWS Transit Gateway?

A. It cannot connect more than 5 VPCs.
B. It operates only within a single AWS Region.
C. It does not support connections from on-premises networks.
D. It does not support IPv6 traffic.

Answer: B

Explanation: A Transit Gateway is a regional resource. It can be used to interconnect thousands of VPCs and on-premises connections within that single region. To connect resources across different regions, you can peer two Transit Gateways together using Transit Gateway Peering.
---
Question #: 927
A CloudFront distribution is configured with a TTL of 0 for a specific path pattern. What is the effect of this?

A. The content will be cached for the default TTL of 24 hours.
B. CloudFront will not cache the content for that path and will forward every request to the origin.
C. This is an invalid configuration and will result in an error.
D. The content will be cached for a very short time, such as 1 second.

Answer: B

Explanation: Setting a Time-To-Live (TTL) of 0 is a way to tell CloudFront that you do not want it to cache the content for that specific cache behavior. This is often done for highly dynamic content or API requests where you need to ensure that every request is sent to the origin server to get the most up-to-date response.
---
Question #: 928
Which of the following scenarios is NOT a good fit for AWS Global Accelerator?

A. A global gaming application using UDP.
B. A global IoT application ingesting telemetry data over TCP.
C. A corporate static website with mostly public, cacheable content.
D. An application that needs to fail over between regions without changing IP addresses.

Answer: C

Explanation: For a static website with cacheable content, Amazon CloudFront is the better and more cost-effective choice. CloudFront is a CDN designed specifically for caching content at the edge. Global Accelerator is designed to improve the performance of the network path for dynamic, non-cacheable, or non-HTTP applications.
---
Question #: 929
You have established a VPC Peering connection. You have updated the route tables. Now you want to enable EC2 instances to resolve private DNS hostnames of instances in the peered VPC. What must be enabled?

A. DNSSEC on your Route 53 hosted zone.
B. Enhanced Networking on the EC2 instances.
C. The "DNS resolution" option in the VPC Peering connection settings for both the requester and accepter.
D. The `enableDnsHostnames` attribute in the VPC settings.

Answer: C

Explanation: Private DNS resolution does not work over a peering connection by default. You must explicitly enable it. This requires modifying the peering connection options from both the requester and the accepter VPCs to allow DNS resolution of private IP addresses.
---
Question #: 930
What is the "hub-and-spoke" model in the context of AWS networking?

A. A model where every VPC is peered with every other VPC in a full mesh.
B. A model where a central VPC or Transit Gateway (the hub) is used to connect multiple other VPCs (the spokes).
C. A model for distributing traffic evenly across multiple Availability Zones.
D. A model for connecting an on-premises network to a single VPC.

Answer: B

Explanation: The hub-and-spoke model is a network topology designed to simplify connectivity. Instead of creating many point-to-point connections, all networks connect to a central hub. The hub then manages the routing between the spokes. AWS Transit Gateway is the primary service for implementing this model in the cloud.
---
Question #: 931
A CloudFront distribution is used to serve an application running on an ALB. You need to ensure that some user-specific, dynamic content is never cached by CloudFront. How can this be achieved?

A. By configuring the origin ALB to send a `Cache-Control: no-cache` header in the response for the dynamic content.
B. By creating a CloudFront invalidation for the dynamic content on every request.
C. By using a Signed URL for the dynamic content.
D. This is not possible; CloudFront caches all content.

Answer: A

Explanation: CloudFront respects the caching headers sent by the origin server. To prevent caching, the origin application should include the `Cache-Control: no-cache`, `private`, or `max-age=0` header in its HTTP response. When CloudFront sees this header, it will not store the response in its cache.
---
Question #: 932
What is an "endpoint group" in AWS Global Accelerator?

A. A collection of one or more endpoints (like ALBs or NLBs) in a specific AWS Region.
B. A security group for the Global Accelerator.
C. A set of static IP addresses.
D. A group of listeners for a specific protocol.

Answer: A

Explanation: An endpoint group is a regional component of a Global Accelerator configuration. You create an endpoint group for each AWS region where you have application endpoints. You can then control the percentage of traffic that is directed to each region by adjusting the "traffic dial" on the endpoint group.
---
Question #: 933
A company is using a Direct Connect connection to link their on-premises network to a VPC. They also want a cost-effective backup connection that will be used only if the Direct Connect fails. What is a common solution?

A. A second, redundant Direct Connect connection.
B. A VPC Peering connection.
C. An AWS Site-to-Site VPN connection configured as a backup.
D. An AWS Global Accelerator.

Answer: C

Explanation: A common high-availability pattern is to use the dedicated, high-bandwidth Direct Connect as the primary path and an internet-based Site-to-Site VPN as a lower-cost backup. You can configure routing (using BGP) to prefer the Direct Connect path and automatically fail over to the VPN if the primary link goes down.
---
Question #: 934
A Transit Gateway has a default route table. All attached VPCs are associated with this default route table and have route propagation enabled. What is the resulting connectivity?

A. None of the VPCs can communicate with each other.
B. Each VPC can only communicate with the on-premises network.
C. All attached VPCs can communicate with each other by default.
D. Only VPCs in the same Availability Zone can communicate.

Answer: C

Explanation: In the default configuration, a Transit Gateway effectively acts like a router on a flat network. The default route table propagates routes from all associated attachments. This means every VPC learns a route to every other VPC, creating a full mesh of connectivity between them.
---
Question #: 935
Which CloudFront feature allows you to run custom JavaScript code at edge locations to modify requests and responses? (Choose TWO)

A. Origin Access Identity (OAI)
B. Lambda@Edge
C. Signed URLs
D. CloudFront Functions
E. Field-Level Encryption

Answer: B, D

Explanation: Both Lambda@Edge (B) and CloudFront Functions (D) are features that allow you to execute code at the AWS edge. CloudFront Functions are lightweight, designed for high-volume, low-latency operations like simple header or URL manipulations. Lambda@Edge is more powerful, has longer execution times, and has network access, making it suitable for more complex tasks like advanced request routing or authentication.
---
Question #: 936
For a tightly coupled High-Performance Computing (HPC) application, you need to launch a fleet of EC2 instances with the highest possible inter-node bandwidth and lowest latency. Which two features are critical for this?

A. An Application Load Balancer
B. A Cluster Placement Group
C. An Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA)
D. A NAT Gateway
E. A VPC Endpoint

Answer: B, C

Explanation: This combination provides the best performance for tightly coupled HPC workloads. The Cluster Placement Group (B) ensures the instances are physically close together on the same network rack. The Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA) (C) provides a specialized network interface that bypasses the OS kernel, offering extremely low latency and high bandwidth, which is ideal for the MPI communication patterns used in these applications.
---
Question #: 937
You are creating a VPC Peering connection between two VPCs in different AWS regions. What is a key difference compared to peering within the same region?

A. It is not possible to peer VPCs across regions.
B. The traffic between the regions is encrypted, and you may incur inter-region data transfer costs.
C. You cannot reference security groups across regions.
D. Both B and C are correct.

Answer: D

Explanation: Inter-region VPC Peering has some key differences. All traffic that travels between regions over the peering connection is automatically encrypted by AWS (B). You also cannot reference a security group from the peered VPC in your security group rules; you must use CIDR blocks instead (C). And, as with any data transfer between regions, standard inter-region data transfer charges will apply.
---
Question #: 938
What is the primary benefit of the AWS global network for services like Global Accelerator and Direct Connect?

A. It is less expensive than the public internet.
B. It is a private, redundant, and highly available network backbone that provides more consistent performance than the public internet.
C. It is accessible from any country in the world.
D. It automatically encrypts all traffic for all services.

Answer: B

Explanation: The AWS global network is a massive, private fiber optic network that interconnects AWS data centers and points of presence. By using services that leverage this network, your traffic avoids the variable performance, congestion, and multiple hops of the public internet, resulting in lower latency, less jitter, and higher reliability.
---
Question #: 939
A CloudFront distribution is configured with S3 as the origin. The S3 bucket is in the `us-east-1` region. A user in Australia requests an image for the first time. What is the request path?

A. User -> S3 in `us-east-1`
B. User -> CloudFront Edge Location in Australia -> S3 in `us-east-1`
C. User -> CloudFront Edge Location in `us-east-1` -> S3 in `us-east-1`
D. User -> CloudFront Edge Location in Australia (cache hit)

Answer: B

Explanation: On the first request for an object (a cache miss), the user's request is directed to the nearest CloudFront edge location (in Australia). Since the content is not in the cache, the edge location then forwards the request back to the origin S3 bucket (in `us-east-1`) to retrieve the object. It then serves the object to the user and caches it for subsequent requests.
---
Question #: 940
What is the main advantage of using a Transit Gateway over a complex mesh of VPC Peering connections?

A. It provides lower latency for all connections.
B. It is less expensive for a small number of VPCs.
C. It simplifies network management and reduces operational overhead at scale.
D. It provides a higher bandwidth limit per connection.

Answer: C

Explanation: The primary driver for adopting Transit Gateway is simplified management. In a mesh network of 10 VPCs, each VPC needs 9 peering connections and route table entries. With a Transit Gateway, each VPC only needs one connection to the central hub. This dramatically simplifies routing, monitoring, and the process of adding or removing new VPCs.
---
Question #: 941
Which of the following services would benefit MOST from AWS Global Accelerator?

A. A static marketing website hosted on S3.
B. A real-time voice-over-IP (VoIP) application.
C. A nightly batch data processing job.
D. An internal code repository.

Answer: B

Explanation: Global Accelerator is designed for applications that are sensitive to latency and jitter and cannot be cached. Real-time communication applications like VoIP and video conferencing are perfect use cases, as Global Accelerator will provide a more stable and performant network path for the TCP/UDP streams compared to the public internet.
---
Question #: 942
You are designing a high-performance network for a machine learning training workload. The EC2 instances need to exchange large amounts of data with each other. Which network interface type should you specify on the instances?

A. Elastic Network Interface (ENI)
B. Elastic IP Address (EIP)
C. Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA)
D. Internet Gateway (IGW)

Answer: C

Explanation: An Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA) is a specialized network interface designed for tightly coupled HPC and machine learning workloads. It supports OS-bypass, allowing direct communication between the application and the network hardware, which drastically reduces latency and is essential for the performance of distributed ML training frameworks.
---
Question #: 943
Can a Transit Gateway be shared with another AWS account?

A. No, a Transit Gateway can only be used by the account that created it.
B. Yes, by using VPC Peering.
C. Yes, by using AWS Resource Access Manager (RAM).
D. Yes, by creating an IAM role.

Answer: C

Explanation: AWS Resource Access Manager (RAM) is the service that allows you to share certain AWS resources with other AWS accounts or within your AWS Organization. Transit Gateway is a shareable resource. The owner account can create the Transit Gateway and then use RAM to share it with other member accounts, allowing them to attach their VPCs to the central gateway.
---
Question #: 944
A CloudFront distribution has a cache behavior with a minimum TTL of 0, a maximum TTL of 3600, and a default TTL of 300. The origin server does not send any caching headers. For how long will CloudFront cache the objects for this behavior?

A. 0 seconds (no caching)
B. 300 seconds
C. 3600 seconds
D. 24 hours

Answer: B

Explanation: If the origin server (like S3 or an ALB) does not provide its own `Cache-Control` or `Expires` headers to specify a TTL, CloudFront will use the "Default TTL" value that you have configured in the cache behavior. In this case, it will cache the object for 300 seconds.
---
Question #: 945
What is the primary function of a VPC endpoint?

A. To provide a public IP address for an instance in a private subnet.
B. To allow private connectivity from a VPC to supported AWS services and VPC endpoint services without requiring an internet gateway, NAT gateway, or VPN connection.
C. To connect two VPCs together.
D. To establish a dedicated connection from an on-premises data center.

Answer: B

Explanation: VPC endpoints are designed to keep traffic between your VPC and other AWS services on the private AWS network. This enhances security by avoiding the public internet and can improve network performance and reduce data transfer costs.
---
Question #: 946
Which of the following is a key feature of AWS Global Accelerator that distinguishes it from a traditional DNS-based load balancer?

A. It provides a static DNS name that never changes.
B. It provides static Anycast IP addresses that act as a fixed entry point and leverages the AWS global network for routing.
C. It can only be used with HTTP traffic.
D. It caches content at the edge.

Answer: B

Explanation: Unlike a service like CloudFront or an ELB which gives you a DNS name, Global Accelerator provides a pair of static IP addresses. These IPs are announced from all AWS edge locations simultaneously using the Anycast protocol. This allows client traffic to enter the AWS network at the closest point and be routed optimally, providing faster and more reliable connections.
---
Question #: 947
You are troubleshooting a VPC Peering connection. An instance in VPC-A can ping an instance in VPC-B, but the application connection on port 8080 is failing. What is the most likely cause?

A. The route tables are misconfigured.
B. The VPC Peering connection is not "active".
C. The security group of the instance in VPC-B does not have an inbound rule allowing traffic on port 8080 from the instance in VPC-A.
D. The Network ACL is blocking all ICMP traffic.

Answer: C

Explanation: If a ping (which uses ICMP) is working, it means the underlying network path is correctly configured (peering is active, route tables are correct, and NACLs are allowing the traffic). The failure of a specific application port points to a Layer 4 firewall rule. The most likely cause is that the security group attached to the destination instance in VPC-B is missing a rule to allow inbound traffic on TCP port 8080.
---
Question #: 948
In a Transit Gateway, what is the difference between a route table "association" and a "propagation"?

A. Association determines which route table an attachment uses, while propagation determines which routes are automatically added to that route table.
B. Association is for VPC attachments, while propagation is for VPN attachments.
C. Association creates a static route, while propagation creates a dynamic route.
D. They are two names for the same function.

Answer: A

Explanation: These are two distinct but related concepts. An "association" links an attachment (like a VPC) to a specific TGW route table. This dictates which route table the VPC will use to make its routing decisions. A "propagation" links an attachment to a TGW route table in a way that allows the TGW to automatically learn the routes *from* that attachment and install them into the route table.
---
Question #: 949
You want to use CloudFront to serve content from a custom origin (your own EC2 web server). What is a critical security consideration for the EC2 instance's security group?

A. It must allow inbound traffic on the HTTP/S port from all IP addresses (0.0.0.0/0).
B. It should be configured to only allow inbound traffic on the HTTP/S port from CloudFront's public IP address ranges.
C. It must be in the same security group as the CloudFront distribution.
D. It should only allow outbound traffic to the CloudFront distribution.

Answer: B

Explanation: To ensure that users cannot bypass CloudFront and access your origin server directly, you should lock down the origin's security group. AWS publishes a list of IP address ranges for its services, including CloudFront. You should create a security group rule that only allows inbound HTTP/S traffic from these specific CloudFront IP ranges, effectively blocking all other direct access.
---
Question #: 950
Which of the following services can act as an endpoint for AWS Global Accelerator? (Choose TWO)

A. Amazon S3 Bucket
B. AWS Lambda Function
C. Application Load Balancer
D. Network Load Balancer
E. A CloudFront Distribution

Answer: C, D

Explanation: AWS Global Accelerator is designed to front network endpoints. The primary endpoint types that you can register in an endpoint group are Application Load Balancers, Network Load Balancers, EC2 instances, and Elastic IP addresses. You cannot use S3, Lambda, or CloudFront as direct endpoints.
---
Question #: 951
When you create a VPC Peering connection, which of the following must be done by both VPC owners?

A. Both must create the peering connection.
B. Both must update their own route tables and security groups.
C. Both must tag the peering connection.
D. Both must use the same IAM role.

Answer: B

Explanation: A peering connection is a partnership. After the requester creates the connection and the accepter accepts it, each VPC owner is responsible for configuring their own side of the connection. This includes updating their respective route tables to direct traffic to the peer, and updating their security groups and NACLs to allow that traffic to flow.
---
Question #: 952
Which of the following is a good use case for a Transit Gateway over VPC Peering?

A. Connecting a development VPC to a testing VPC for a short-term project.
B. Creating a simple, low-cost connection between two VPCs in the same account.
C. Building a centralized network architecture for a large organization with dozens of VPCs and multiple on-premises connections.
D. Enabling private DNS resolution between two VPCs.

Answer: C

Explanation: Transit Gateway shines at scale. While VPC Peering is great for simple one-to-one connections, a Transit Gateway is the superior choice for building a scalable and manageable network for a large number of VPCs and hybrid connections, as it avoids the complexity of a fully meshed peering topology.
---
Question #: 953
You are using CloudFront to serve a website from an S3 origin. You want different caching rules for your images (`/images/*`) and your API responses (`/api/*`). How do you configure this?

A. By creating two separate CloudFront distributions.
B. By creating multiple S3 buckets.
C. By creating different "Cache Behaviors" in your CloudFront distribution, each with its own path pattern and caching settings.
D. By using Lambda@Edge to apply different caching headers.

Answer: C

Explanation: A single CloudFront distribution can have multiple cache behaviors. You would have a default behavior and then create additional behaviors for specific path patterns. For example, you would create a cache behavior for the path pattern `/images/*` with a long TTL, and another for `/api/*` with a TTL of 0 to prevent caching.
---
Question #: 954
For a tightly-coupled HPC workload in a cluster placement group, which EC2 network feature provides OS-bypass for the lowest latency?

A. ENA (Elastic Network Adapter)
B. EFA (Elastic Fabric Adapter)
C. EIP (Elastic IP Address)
D. ENI (Elastic Network Interface)

Answer: B

Explanation: The Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA) is specifically designed for HPC and ML workloads. Its key feature is OS-bypass, which allows supported applications to communicate directly with the network hardware, significantly reducing latency and jitter for inter-node communication.
---
Question #: 955
A VPC in Account A needs to access a service in a VPC in Account B. The service is exposed via a Network Load Balancer. The architects want to establish this connection without using VPC Peering or a Transit Gateway. What service enables this private connectivity?

A. AWS Global Accelerator
B. AWS Direct Connect
C. AWS PrivateLink (via a VPC Endpoint Service)
D. AWS Site-to-Site VPN

Answer: C

Explanation: AWS PrivateLink is the technology designed for this use case. The service provider (Account B) creates a VPC Endpoint Service and attaches their NLB to it. The consumer (Account A) then creates an Interface VPC Endpoint for that service in their own VPC. This creates a secure, private connection between the two VPCs that does not traverse the internet and does not require complex routing changes.
---
Question #: 956
What is the default routing behavior of a newly created Transit Gateway route table?

A. It contains routes to all attached VPCs.
B. It is empty except for a blackhole route.
C. It contains a default route to the internet.
D. It has a single route for the local VPC.

Answer: B

Explanation: Unlike a VPC route table which has a local route, a new Transit Gateway route table is effectively empty. No routing will occur until you either add static routes or enable route propagation from your attachments. The default is to have no paths, ensuring a secure-by-default posture.
---
Question #: 957
A CloudFront distribution has an origin that is slow to respond. To improve the user experience, you want to serve the last cached version of an object even if it has expired, while CloudFront fetches the new version in the background. What feature enables this?

A. A long TTL value.
B. The `stale-while-revalidate` and `stale-if-error` Cache-Control directives in the origin's response.
C. Origin Shield.
D. Field-Level Encryption.

Answer: B

Explanation: These `Cache-Control` headers provide more granular control over stale content. `stale-while-revalidate` tells CloudFront it can serve a stale version of the content to the user immediately, while it asynchronously revalidates the content with the origin. `stale-if-error` allows CloudFront to serve stale content if the origin is returning an error.
---
Question #: 958
Which of the following is a primary benefit of AWS Global Accelerator?

A. It provides a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to protect against exploits.
B. It improves application availability by using the AWS global network to route around public internet issues.
C. It caches dynamic content at the edge.
D. It reduces the cost of data transfer out of AWS.

Answer: B

Explanation: By ingressing traffic at the nearest edge location and carrying it over the AWS backbone, Global Accelerator can automatically route around unhealthy or congested paths on the public internet. Combined with its instant regional failover, this significantly improves the availability and resilience of your application.
---
Question #: 959
You need to connect three VPCs (A, B, C) and a VPN connection. VPC-A should be able to talk to B, C, and the VPN. VPC-B and VPC-C should NOT be able to talk to each other. How can you achieve this with a Transit Gateway?

A. This is not possible; a Transit Gateway provides full mesh connectivity.
B. Use two separate Transit Gateways.
C. Use a single Transit Gateway with multiple custom route tables to create an isolated routing domain for B and C.
D. Use VPC Peering for A-B and A-C, and a Transit Gateway for the VPN.

Answer: C

Explanation: This is a key use case for custom TGW route tables. You can create a "main" route table that VPC-A and the VPN are associated with, and which has routes to all networks. Then you create a separate, more restrictive route table that VPC-B and VPC-C are associated with. This second table would have routes to VPC-A and the VPN, but not to each other, thus enforcing the required network segmentation.
---
Question #: 960
You want to use your own custom SSL/TLS certificate for a CloudFront distribution. What is a prerequisite?

A. The certificate must be a wildcard certificate.
B. The certificate must be imported into or provisioned by AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) in the us-east-1 region.
C. The certificate's private key must be uploaded to the S3 origin bucket.
D. You must use a Dedicated IP for your CloudFront distribution.

Answer: B

Explanation: For a CloudFront distribution to use a custom SSL/TLS certificate, the certificate must be managed by AWS Certificate Manager (ACM). A critical requirement is that for CloudFront, the ACM certificate MUST be requested or imported in the `us-east-1` (N. Virginia) region, regardless of where your origin or users are located.
---
Question #: 961
Which of the following is true about traffic flowing over a VPC Peering connection?

A. It is encrypted by default when peering is within a region.
B. It is not encrypted when peering is within a region, but it is encrypted for inter-region peering.
C. All traffic is unencrypted by default.
D. All traffic is encrypted by default, regardless of region.

Answer: B

Explanation: Traffic between instances in peered VPCs that are in the same AWS region is not encrypted by default; it stays within the private AWS network but is not encrypted at the peering layer. However, when you create an inter-region VPC Peering connection, all traffic that traverses between the regions is automatically encrypted by AWS.
---
Question #: 962
An application is experiencing high TCP connection setup times for users who are far away from the application's single AWS region. How can AWS Global Accelerator help?

A. By caching the application's content closer to the users.
B. By terminating the TCP connection at a nearby edge location, which is closer to the user, and then forwarding packets over the optimized AWS network.
C. By providing the user with a direct, private connection to the AWS region.
D. By using UDP instead of TCP.

Answer: B

Explanation: The initial TCP handshake (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK) can have high latency over long distances. Global Accelerator improves this by having the user perform the handshake with a nearby AWS edge location. The packets are then forwarded from the edge to your application over the fast and stable AWS global network, reducing the overall connection setup time.
---
Question #: 963
What is the function of the "Origin Shield" feature in CloudFront?

A. It is a Web Application Firewall for the origin.
B. It adds an extra layer of caching between the CloudFront edge locations and your origin server.
C. It restricts access to the origin using an Origin Access Identity.
D. It shields the origin from DDoS attacks.

Answer: B

Explanation: Origin Shield is an additional caching layer within the CloudFront architecture. It sits in a regional edge cache (REC) in front of your origin. All requests from all the individual edge locations that miss their cache will be consolidated and sent to the Origin Shield. This significantly reduces the request load on your origin, improving its availability and reducing its operational costs.
---
Question #: 964
You are designing a hybrid network. You have a 10 Gbps AWS Direct Connect connection. You need to connect 5 VPCs in the same region to your on-premises network over this connection. What is the most scalable way to do this?

A. Create a dedicated Virtual Interface (VIF) for each VPC on the Direct Connect connection.
B. Create one Transit VIF on the Direct Connect connection, connect it to a Direct Connect Gateway, and then associate that with a Transit Gateway that is attached to the 5 VPCs.
C. Create a VPN over the Direct Connect connection for each VPC.
D. Peer all 5 VPCs together and connect one of them to the Direct Connect.

Answer: B

Explanation: The modern and scalable approach is to use a Transit VIF. A single Transit VIF can connect to a Direct Connect Gateway, which can then be associated with up to three Transit Gateways. The Transit Gateway then provides connectivity to all the attached VPCs. This avoids having to manage multiple VIFs and BGP sessions for each VPC.
---
Question #: 965
You have a CloudFront distribution for your website. You want to add a `Strict-Transport-Security` header to all responses to improve security. What is the most efficient way to do this?

A. Configure your origin server (e.g., S3 or ALB) to add the header.
B. Use a CloudFront Function to add the header to the viewer response.
C. Use a Lambda@Edge function on the origin response event.
D. Use AWS WAF to inject the header.

Answer: B

Explanation: Adding or modifying HTTP headers is a perfect use case for CloudFront Functions. They are extremely lightweight, high-performance, and cost-effective. You would create a simple function that triggers on the "viewer response" event and adds the required HSTS header before the response is sent to the client.
---
Question #: 966
What is the primary architectural difference between a VPC Endpoint Gateway and a VPC Endpoint Interface?

A. Gateway endpoints are for S3 and DynamoDB, while Interface endpoints are for most other services.
B. Gateway endpoints use an ENI in your subnet, while Interface endpoints use a route table entry.
C. Gateway endpoints are more expensive than Interface endpoints.
D. A Gateway endpoint is a route table target in your VPC, while an Interface endpoint is an Elastic Network Interface (ENI) with a private IP in your subnet.

Answer: D

Explanation: This is the key distinction. A Gateway Endpoint is a gateway that you specify as a target in a route table for traffic destined for S3 or DynamoDB. An Interface Endpoint (powered by PrivateLink) creates an actual network interface in your subnet with a private IP address, which you can then connect to as if the service were running inside your VPC.

Question #: 967
A company has a legacy application that relies on multicast for service discovery. They want to migrate this application to AWS. Which networking service can support multicast traffic between EC2 instances in a VPC?

A. VPC Peering
B. AWS Transit Gateway
C. AWS Global Accelerator
D. AWS Direct Connect

Answer: B

Explanation: AWS Transit Gateway has a feature that allows you to create a "multicast domain". This enables you to send multicast traffic between sources and receivers in different VPCs attached to the Transit Gateway, which is not supported by native VPC networking or peering.
---
Question #: 968
You are using a CloudFront distribution with an ALB as the origin. How does CloudFront handle health checks for the origin?

A. CloudFront uses the same health checks that are configured on the ALB's target group.
B. CloudFront does not perform active health checks; it only fails over based on HTTP error codes.
C. CloudFront relies on Route 53 health checks to determine origin health.
D. You must configure a separate health check within the CloudFront distribution.

Answer: B

Explanation: By default, CloudFront does not perform its own active health checks on the origin. If CloudFront receives an error response (e.g., a 5xx error) from the origin, it will consider that request to have failed. For high availability, you should configure an origin group with a primary and secondary origin, and CloudFront will automatically fail over to the secondary if the primary returns specific error codes.

Question #: 969
Which service provides a pair of static Anycast IP addresses that act as a single, fixed entry point for your global application?

A. Elastic Load Balancing
B. Amazon CloudFront
C. AWS Global Accelerator
D. Amazon Route 53

Answer: C

Explanation: A defining feature of AWS Global Accelerator is that it provides two static IP addresses that are announced from all AWS edge locations using the Anycast BGP protocol. This means users are automatically directed to the nearest edge location, and these IPs remain constant even if you change your backend regional endpoints.
---
Question #: 970
A company needs to peer two VPCs that have overlapping CIDR blocks. What is a possible solution?

A. This is not possible; the CIDR blocks must be changed.
B. Use AWS PrivateLink to expose a service from one VPC to the other without routing between them.
C. Use a Transit Gateway, which can handle overlapping CIDRs.
D. Both B and C are potential solutions.

Answer: D

Explanation: Overlapping CIDRs are a common networking challenge. You cannot directly peer the VPCs. However, you can use other services as a workaround. AWS PrivateLink (B) allows you to expose a specific service via an endpoint, which doesn't require CIDR overlap. A Transit Gateway (C) can also be used, as it performs network address translation, allowing it to connect VPCs even if their IP ranges conflict. The best solution depends on the specific use case.
---
Question #: 971
What is the function of "Field-Level Encryption" in Amazon CloudFront?

A. It encrypts the entire request body sent to the origin.
B. It allows you to selectively encrypt specific sensitive data in an incoming POST request (e.g., credit card numbers in a form) at the edge before it is forwarded to your origin.
C. It encrypts the headers of a request.
D. It encrypts the content in the CloudFront cache.

Answer: B

Explanation: Field-Level Encryption is a security feature that enhances the protection of sensitive data. You can configure it to intercept a POST request at the edge, find specific fields in the request body, and encrypt their values using a public key. This ensures that the sensitive data is never visible in plaintext to any part of your backend infrastructure.
---
Question #: 972
You have a Transit Gateway with attachments to VPC-A, VPC-B, and a VPN. You want to allow VPC-A and VPC-B to communicate with the VPN, but not with each other. How do you configure the TGW route tables?

A. Use a single route table and enable propagation from all attachments.
B. Create two separate route tables. Associate VPC-A with one and VPC-B with the other. In each route table, add a route to the VPN, but not to the other VPC.
C. This requires two different Transit Gateways.
D. Use Network ACLs on the Transit Gateway to block the inter-VPC traffic.

Answer: B

Explanation: This is a classic network segmentation use case for Transit Gateway. By creating separate route tables (routing domains), you can control connectivity. VPC-A's route table would have a route to the VPN but not VPC-B. VPC-B's route table would have a route to the VPN but not VPC-A. The VPN attachment would be associated with a route table that has routes to both VPCs.
---
Question #: 973
What is the main performance benefit of a Cluster Placement Group?

A. High availability across multiple hardware racks.
B. Low network latency and high throughput between instances within the group.
C. Reduced cost for data transfer between instances.
D. Increased EBS I/O performance.

Answer: B

Explanation: The sole purpose of a Cluster Placement Group is to co-locate instances on the same high-speed network rack within a single Availability Zone. This minimizes the physical distance between them, resulting in the lowest possible network latency and the highest possible packet-per-second performance, which is essential for tightly coupled applications.
---
Question #: 974
A company has a Direct Connect connection and a backup Site-to-Site VPN. Both are connected to a Transit Gateway. How can they ensure that traffic always prefers the Direct Connect link?

A. This is the default behavior; Direct Connect is always preferred.
B. By using BGP and advertising a more specific route or a shorter AS_PATH from their on-premises network over the Direct Connect link.
C. By configuring the Transit Gateway route table with a static route for the Direct Connect.
D. By disabling the VPN connection and only enabling it during a failure.

Answer: B

Explanation: In a dynamic routing environment, you control path preference using BGP attributes. To make Direct Connect the primary path, you would advertise the same network prefixes over both connections, but you would make the path over Direct Connect more preferable. This can be done by advertising a more specific route or by using AS_PATH prepending on the VPN connection to make its path seem longer and less desirable to the router.
---
Question #: 975
Which CloudFront feature allows you to route different percentages of traffic to two different origins for A/B testing?

A. Multiple cache behaviors
B. Origin groups
C. Continuous deployment with traffic shifting policies
D. Lambda@Edge

Answer: C

Explanation: CloudFront's continuous deployment feature allows you to safely test changes. You can have a primary distribution and a staging distribution. You can then use traffic configuration policies (either header-based or weight-based) to direct a certain percentage of your viewer traffic to the staging distribution to test changes before promoting it to production.
---
Question #: 976
An application behind AWS Global Accelerator needs to identify the original client IP address for logging and analytics. How can the application get this information?

A. The original client IP is preserved as the source IP of the packets arriving at the endpoint.
B. The original client IP is available in the `X-Forwarded-For` HTTP header.
C. This is not possible when using Global Accelerator.
D. The behavior depends on whether the endpoint is an ALB or an NLB.

Answer: D

Explanation: The behavior is different for different endpoint types. For Application Load Balancer endpoints, Global Accelerator preserves the client IP address and it appears as the source IP at the ALB. For Network Load Balancer and EC2 instance endpoints, Global Accelerator does *not* preserve the client IP; the source IP seen by the application will be a private IP of the Global Accelerator service. For these endpoints, you must enable Proxy Protocol v2 to get the client IP.
---
Question #: 977
Which of the following is a key characteristic of an AWS Direct Connect connection?

A. It provides a quick and low-cost way to connect to AWS.
B. It provides a dedicated, private network connection with consistent performance.
C. It encrypts all traffic by default.
D. It can be set up and configured entirely through the AWS Management Console.

Answer: B

Explanation: The primary benefits of Direct Connect are its private nature and performance consistency. It is a physical fiber-optic connection, not a connection over the public internet, which means it is not subject to the congestion and variability of the internet. This provides a much more stable and predictable network experience. It is not encrypted by default and requires coordination with a network provider to set up.
---
Question #: 978
You have a Transit Gateway in `us-east-1` and another in `eu-west-1`. You need to enable communication between VPCs attached to these two Transit Gateways. What should you configure?

A. A VPC Peering connection between a VPC in each region.
B. An inter-region Transit Gateway Peering connection.
C. An AWS Global Accelerator between the two Transit Gateways.
D. A Site-to-Site VPN between the two Transit Gateways.

Answer: B

Explanation: To connect Transit Gateways in different regions, you use the Transit Gateway Peering feature. You create a peering attachment on each Transit Gateway and then create routes in your TGW route tables to direct traffic destined for the other region to the peering attachment.
---
Question #: 979
You want to use CloudFront to serve an API hosted on API Gateway. What is a key benefit of this architecture?

A. CloudFront can cache API responses at the edge, reducing latency and the load on API Gateway.
B. CloudFront provides a static IP address for the API Gateway.
C. CloudFront can directly invoke the backend Lambda functions.
D. CloudFront adds an extra layer of encryption to the API requests.

Answer: A

Explanation: Placing CloudFront in front of API Gateway is a common pattern to improve performance and reduce costs. You can configure a cache behavior in CloudFront to cache the responses of your API's GET requests. Subsequent identical requests can then be served directly from the CloudFront edge cache, resulting in lower latency for users and fewer requests (and lower costs) being processed by API Gateway and your backend.
---
Question #: 980
A high-frequency trading application is running on EC2 instances. Which of the following is MOST critical for its performance?

A. High storage throughput (MB/s)
B. High storage IOPS
C. Low network latency and jitter
D. A large amount of RAM

Answer: C

Explanation: High-frequency trading applications are extremely sensitive to network performance. Low latency (the time it takes for a packet to travel) and low jitter (the variation in latency) are critical to ensure that trades can be executed as quickly and predictably as possible. Features like Cluster Placement Groups and Elastic Fabric Adapters are designed for this type of workload.
---
Question #: 981
You have a VPC Peering connection between VPC-A and VPC-B. An EC2 instance in VPC-A needs to communicate with the internet. It does not have a public IP. VPC-B has a NAT Gateway. Can the instance in VPC-A use the NAT Gateway in VPC-B?

A. Yes, if the route tables are configured correctly.
B. No, this is an example of transitive routing, which is not supported by VPC Peering.
C. Yes, but only if the VPCs are in the same AWS account.
D. No, because the security groups will block the traffic.

Answer: B

Explanation: An instance in VPC-A cannot "transit" through VPC-B to reach a gateway (like a NAT Gateway or Internet Gateway) attached to VPC-B. The peering connection only allows communication between the private IPs within the two VPCs. This type of edge-to-edge routing is a form of transitive routing and is not supported.
---
Question #: 982
In a Transit Gateway, if a packet arrives and there is no matching route in the associated route table, what happens to the packet?

A. It is forwarded to the default attachment.
B. It is sent to all attachments.
C. It is dropped (a blackhole route).
D. It is sent back to the source.

Answer: C

Explanation: Like a traditional router, if a Transit Gateway does not have a specific route for a destination network, the packet is dropped. This is why it's critical to ensure your route tables are configured correctly with either static routes or dynamic propagations for all the destinations your attachments need to reach.
---
Question #: 983
Which of the following is an example of a "cache key" in CloudFront?

A. The IAM key used to access the origin.
B. The combination of values (like the URL, headers, and cookies) that uniquely identifies an object in the cache.
C. The encryption key used for field-level encryption.
D. A tag on the CloudFront distribution.

Answer: B

Explanation: The cache key is what CloudFront uses to look up an object in its cache. By default, this is just the request URL. However, you can configure the cache policy to include other components in the cache key, such as specific HTTP headers or cookies. If two requests have the exact same cache key, CloudFront considers them a request for the same object.
---
Question #: 984
You need to establish a 500 Mbps encrypted connection between your on-premises data center and a VPC. The connection needs to be set up quickly and cost-effectively. What is the best option?

A. AWS Direct Connect
B. AWS Site-to-Site VPN
C. AWS Global Accelerator
D. VPC Peering

Answer: B

Explanation: An AWS Site-to-Site VPN provides an encrypted (IPsec) tunnel over the public internet. It is relatively quick to set up and is a cost-effective solution for bandwidth requirements in this range. A Direct Connect (A) connection provides higher, more consistent performance but is more expensive and takes much longer to provision.
---
Question #: 985
When would you choose a Network Load Balancer over an Application Load Balancer?

A. When you need to route traffic based on the URL path.
B. When you need to load balance non-HTTP traffic or require extreme performance with a static IP.
C. When you need to authenticate users with Amazon Cognito.
D. When you want to use AWS WAF for protection.

Answer: B

Explanation: You should choose an NLB when you need to handle TCP/UDP traffic at scale with ultra-low latency. It is also the only ELB type that can provide a static Elastic IP per AZ. ALBs are for HTTP/S traffic and provide more advanced, content-based routing features.
---
Question #: 986
A company has a multi-region application fronted by AWS Global Accelerator. All endpoints are healthy. How does Global Accelerator route traffic from a user?

A. It routes the user to the region with the lowest cost.
B. It routes the user to the region with the most available capacity.
C. It routes the user's traffic to the AWS edge location closest to them, then over the AWS network to the best regional endpoint.
D. It routes the user to a random region.

Answer: C

Explanation: Global Accelerator uses the Anycast protocol to ingest traffic at the edge location that is geographically and topologically closest to the end-user. It then intelligently routes that traffic over its congestion-free global network to the healthiest application endpoint, providing a significant performance boost.
---
Question #: 987
What is a key benefit of using a Transit Gateway for hybrid connectivity with multiple VPN connections?

A. It increases the encryption strength of the VPNs.
B. It allows you to terminate multiple VPN connections on a single gateway, simplifying the on-premises router configuration.
C. It eliminates the need for a customer gateway device.
D. It provides a higher bandwidth limit than a standard VPN connection.

Answer: B

Explanation: A Transit Gateway can be configured with an Equal-Cost Multi-Path (ECMP) routing strategy over multiple VPN tunnels. This not only provides higher aggregate bandwidth but also simplifies the configuration on both ends. You terminate all VPNs on the single TGW, which acts as the hub, rather than managing separate connections to each VPC.
---
Question #: 988
You want to serve different versions of your website to users based on the device they are using (e.g., mobile or desktop). How can you achieve this with CloudFront?

A. By using different origins for mobile and desktop and using Lambda@Edge to inspect the `User-Agent` header and route the request to the correct origin.
B. By using two different CloudFront distributions.
C. By using Geolocation routing.
D. This is not possible with CloudFront.

Answer: A

Explanation: This is a classic use case for Lambda@Edge. You can create a function that triggers on the "origin request" event. This function's code can inspect the `User-Agent` header of the incoming request. Based on whether the user agent indicates a mobile or desktop device, the function can dynamically change the origin that CloudFront forwards the request to.
---
Question #: 989
What is a primary consideration when designing a high-performance networking architecture on AWS?

A. Minimizing the number of IAM roles.
B. Choosing the right EC2 instance types with appropriate network performance and enabling enhanced networking.
C. Using only the default VPC.
D. Storing all data in a single Availability Zone.

Answer: B

Explanation: The EC2 instance itself is often the source or destination of the network traffic. The instance's network performance, which is determined by its type and size and enabled by features like Enhanced Networking (ENA/EFA), is a critical factor in the overall performance of the application.
---
Question #: 990
You have a CloudFront distribution serving your website. You want to ensure all traffic between viewers and CloudFront, and also between CloudFront and your S3 origin, is encrypted. What do you need to configure?

A. Set the Viewer Protocol Policy to "Redirect HTTP to HTTPS" and configure the Origin Protocol Policy to "HTTPS Only".
B. Set the Viewer Protocol Policy to "HTTPS Only" and enable S3 default encryption.
C. Enable AWS Shield Advanced.
D. Use a Signed URL for all content.

Answer: A

Explanation: This requires configuring both "legs" of the connection. Setting the Viewer Protocol Policy to redirect or require HTTPS ensures the user-to-CloudFront connection is encrypted. Setting the Origin Protocol Policy to "HTTPS Only" ensures that the connection from CloudFront back to your origin (S3 in this case) is also encrypted.
---
Question #: 991
Which service acts as a regional virtual router for traffic flowing between your VPCs, VPNs, and Direct Connect connections?

A. Internet Gateway
B. NAT Gateway
C. VPC Peering
D. AWS Transit Gateway

Answer: D

Explanation: An AWS Transit Gateway is fundamentally a managed, regional cloud router. It is designed to be the central hub for all network traffic within a region, simplifying connectivity and routing logic between various network attachments.
---
Question #: 992
You are using Global Accelerator with an NLB endpoint. Your application needs the client's original IP address. How must you configure the NLB's target group?

A. Enable sticky sessions.
B. Enable proxy protocol v2.
C. Enable cross-zone load balancing.
D. Enable health checks.

Answer: B

Explanation: When fronting an NLB or EC2 instance with Global Accelerator, the client IP is not preserved by default. To pass the client's IP address to your application, you must enable Proxy Protocol v2 on the NLB's target group. The NLB will then add a header to the TCP request containing the original source IP.
---
Question #: 993
A company wants to connect its on-premises data center to 30 VPCs, spread across three different AWS Regions. What is the most scalable and manageable solution?

A. Create a Site-to-Site VPN to each of the 30 VPCs.
B. Create a Direct Connect connection to each of the 30 VPCs.
C. In each region, deploy a Transit Gateway connected to the local VPCs. Peer the three Transit Gateways together. Use a Direct Connect Gateway to connect the on-premises network to the Transit Gateways.
D. Peer all 30 VPCs together in a full mesh.

Answer: C

Explanation: This architecture provides a scalable and robust global network. The Transit Gateway in each region simplifies local connectivity. Inter-Region TGW Peering connects the regions. A Direct Connect Gateway acts as a global entry point, allowing you to use a single Direct Connect connection to reach resources across all three connected regions via their Transit Gateways.
---
Question #: 994
What is a CloudFront "Origin Group"?

A. A group of users who are allowed to access a specific origin.
B. A feature that allows you to configure a primary and a secondary origin to enable high-availability and origin failover.
C. A group of edge locations that belong to a specific geographic region.
D. A security group for your origin server.

Answer: B

Explanation: An Origin Group is a CloudFront feature for high availability. You can group two origins (a primary and a secondary). You configure CloudFront to fail over to the secondary origin if the primary origin returns specific HTTP error status codes, providing resilience against origin failures.
---
Question #: 995
What is the primary function of an Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA)?

A. To provide a high-bandwidth connection to Amazon S3.
B. To provide a low-latency, OS-bypass network interface for high-performance computing (HPC) and machine learning workloads.
C. To allow a single EC2 instance to have multiple elastic IP addresses.
D. To connect an EC2 instance to an on-premises network.

Answer: B

Explanation: EFA is a specialized network interface designed to accelerate inter-node communication for tightly coupled applications. Its OS-bypass capability allows applications using libraries like MPI to communicate directly with the network hardware, which dramatically reduces latency and improves the performance of large, distributed computing jobs.
---
Question #: 996
You have a global application with endpoints in three regions fronted by AWS Global Accelerator. You want to temporarily take one region out of service for maintenance without affecting users. What is the most graceful way to do this?

A. Stop the EC2 instances in that region's endpoint group.
B. Delete the endpoint group for that region.
C. Adjust the "traffic dial" for that region's endpoint group down to 0%.
D. Change the DNS records to point away from that region.

Answer: C

Explanation: The traffic dial is a feature of Global Accelerator's endpoint groups that allows you to control the percentage of traffic that is directed to a specific region. To gracefully remove a region from service, you can simply adjust its traffic dial down to 0. Global Accelerator will stop sending any new traffic to that region and distribute it among the remaining healthy regions.
---
Question #: 997
Which of the following must be updated to allow traffic to flow between two peered VPCs? (Choose TWO)

A. The VPC Peering connection's IAM role.
B. The Route Tables in each VPC.
C. The Security Groups of the communicating instances.
D. The NACLs of the communicating subnets (if they are not default).
E. The Internet Gateway for each VPC.

Answer: B, C

Explanation: After a peering connection is active, two things are required to enable traffic flow. First, the Route Tables (B) in each VPC must be updated with routes that point to the other VPC's CIDR block via the peering connection. Second, the Security Groups (C) attached to the instances must have rules that allow traffic from the source instance's IP, security group, or CIDR block on the required ports. NACLs (D) must also allow the traffic, but the default NACL allows everything, so it often doesn't need modification.
---
Question #: 998
A video streaming company is using CloudFront to deliver its content. They want to restrict access so that only authenticated users from their website can view the videos, and the video links should expire after 5 minutes. What CloudFront feature should they use?

A. Origin Access Identity (OAI)
B. Field-Level Encryption
C. AWS WAF integration
D. CloudFront Signed URLs

Answer: D

Explanation: This is the classic use case for Signed URLs. The company's web application, after authenticating a user, would generate a unique and temporary URL for the video file. This URL contains a policy (e.g., expiration time) and a cryptographic signature. Only users with this valid, unexpired, and correctly signed URL will be able to access the video content through CloudFront.
---
Question #: 999
A web application is deployed on a fleet of EC2 instances behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB). To ensure high availability, how should the EC2 instances and subnets be configured?

A. Deploy all EC2 instances in a single subnet within a single Availability Zone.
B. Deploy the EC2 instances across multiple subnets, with each subnet in a different AWS Region.
C. Deploy the EC2 instances across multiple subnets, with each subnet in a different Availability Zone in the same region, and configure the ALB to target all of them.
D. Deploy a single, large EC2 instance to handle all traffic.

Answer: C

Explanation: For high availability, you must design your application to be resilient to the failure of a single Availability Zone. The correct architecture is to place your instances in multiple AZs and have the load balancer distribute traffic across them. If one AZ fails, the ALB will route traffic to the healthy instances in the other AZs. Spreading across regions (B) is for disaster recovery, not high availability for an ALB.
---
Question #: 1000
An Auto Scaling group is configured with a desired capacity of 3, a minimum size of 2, and a maximum size of 6. An EC2 instance within the group fails its health check. What will Auto Scaling do?

A. Terminate the unhealthy instance and launch a new one to maintain the desired capacity of 3.
B. Do nothing until the number of instances drops below the minimum of 2.
C. Launch a new instance, bringing the total to 4, and then terminate the unhealthy one.
D. Terminate all instances and launch 3 new ones.

Answer: A

Explanation: The primary purpose of an Auto Scaling group is to maintain a fixed, desired number of running instances. When it detects an unhealthy instance through health checks, its default behavior is to terminate that instance and launch a replacement to bring the count back to the desired capacity.
---
Question #: 1001
What is the primary function of an Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)?

A. To automatically increase or decrease the number of EC2 instances based on demand.
B. To distribute incoming application traffic across multiple targets, such as EC2 instances, in multiple Availability Zones.
C. To provide a static public IP address for an EC2 instance.
D. To cache content at edge locations to reduce latency.

Answer: B

Explanation: An Elastic Load Balancer acts as a single point of contact for clients and distributes incoming traffic across a fleet of backend targets. This improves application availability and scalability by preventing any single instance from being a point of failure or bottleneck. Auto Scaling (A) handles instance scaling. Elastic IP (C) provides a static IP. CloudFront (D) caches content.
---
Question #: 1002
You are designing a solution that requires a load balancer that can operate at the transport layer (Layer 4), offering ultra-high performance and a static IP address. Which type of ELB should you choose?

A. Application Load Balancer (ALB)
B. Network Load Balancer (NLB)
C. Classic Load Balancer (CLB)
D. Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB)

Answer: B

Explanation: A Network Load Balancer (NLB) is the correct choice for Layer 4 load balancing. It is designed to handle millions of requests per second with extremely low latency. A key feature of the NLB is its ability to provide a static IP address per Availability Zone (or an Elastic IP), which is often required for whitelisting.
---
Question #: 1003
An Auto Scaling group is using a "Target Tracking" scaling policy with the "Average CPU Utilization" metric set to 50%. The current average CPU across the 4 instances in the group is 75%. What will the Auto Scaling group do?

A. Do nothing, as the maximum size has not been reached.
B. Terminate two instances to bring the average CPU utilization down.
C. Launch two new instances to bring the average CPU utilization down towards the 50% target.
D. Send an SNS notification to the administrator.

Answer: C

Explanation: A target tracking policy is designed to keep a metric at or near a specified target value. If the actual metric (75% CPU) is higher than the target (50%), the Auto Scaling group will scale out by adding instances. It will calculate the number of instances needed to bring the average back to the target. In this case, adding two instances would increase capacity by 50%, theoretically reducing the average CPU from 75% to 50% (4 * 75% = 300 units of work; 300 / 6 instances = 50%).
---
Question #: 1004
What is the purpose of an ELB "health check"?

A. To check if the IAM permissions for the load balancer are correct.
B. To determine whether a registered target (e.g., an EC2 instance) is healthy and able to receive traffic.
C. To monitor the overall health of the AWS region.
D. To check if the load balancer itself is functioning correctly.

Answer: B

Explanation: The load balancer periodically sends requests (health checks) to its registered targets to test their status. If a target fails these health checks, the ELB stops sending live application traffic to it and reroutes the traffic to the remaining healthy targets. This is a critical component of a high-availability setup.
---
Question #: 1005
Which Auto Scaling group setting ensures that if you manually add an instance to the group and the group later needs to scale in, the newly launched instances are terminated first?

A. The "OldestInstance" termination policy.
B. The "NewestInstance" termination policy.
C. The "Default" termination policy.
D. The "ClosestToNextInstanceHour" termination policy.

Answer: B

Explanation: The "NewestInstance" termination policy is designed for this scenario. It instructs the Auto Scaling group to terminate the most recently launched instance first during a scale-in event. This is useful for protecting long-running instances or instances that might have state. The default policy (C) is more complex and tries to balance instances across AZs.
---
Question #: 1006
An Application Load Balancer has listeners configured for both HTTP on port 80 and HTTPS on port 443. How can you ensure that all user traffic sent to HTTP is automatically redirected to HTTPS?

A. This must be handled by a web server configuration (e.g., Apache, Nginx) on the backend instances.
B. Create a listener rule on the HTTP listener that performs a redirect action to the HTTPS URL.
C. Use Amazon Route 53 to redirect the traffic.
D. Use a Network Load Balancer in front of the Application Load Balancer.

Answer: B

Explanation: Application Load Balancers have advanced routing capabilities, including listener rules. You can configure the HTTP listener on port 80 to have a default rule with a "Redirect" action. This rule can be configured to redirect all incoming HTTP requests to the same host and path on port 443 (HTTPS), enforcing secure connections at the load balancer level.
---
Question #: 1007
What is a "launch template" or "launch configuration" in the context of Auto Scaling?

A. A set of rules that determines when to scale out or scale in.
B. A template that specifies the parameters for launching new EC2 instances, such as the AMI ID, instance type, key pair, and security groups.
C. A script that is run on an instance after it is launched to install software.
D. A configuration that defines the health checks for the instances.

Answer: B

Explanation: Before an Auto Scaling group can launch instances, it needs to know *what* to launch. A launch template (the newer, recommended method) or a launch configuration serves as this blueprint. It contains all the necessary information, like the AMI, instance type, storage, and networking settings, that Auto Scaling will use to create new instances.
---
Question #: 1008
To achieve high availability for a stateful application like a relational database, what is the standard AWS deployment model?

A. Deploy a single, large database instance in one Availability Zone.
B. Deploy the database on an EC2 instance and use an Auto Scaling group to scale it.
C. Deploy the database using Amazon RDS with the Multi-AZ option enabled.
D. Deploy the database in one region and create a read replica in another region.

Answer: C

Explanation: Amazon RDS Multi-AZ is the purpose-built solution for database high availability. When enabled, RDS automatically provisions and maintains a synchronous standby replica of your database in a different Availability Zone. In the event of an infrastructure failure, RDS automatically fails over to the standby, minimizing downtime. Auto Scaling (B) is not suitable for stateful databases.
---
Question #: 1009
An Auto Scaling group has a "cooldown period" of 300 seconds (5 minutes). A scaling-out policy is triggered, and a new instance is launched. Three minutes later, the alarm threshold is breached again. What will happen?

A. The Auto Scaling group will immediately launch another instance.
B. The Auto Scaling group will ignore the second alarm because it is still within the cooldown period.
C. The Auto Scaling group will terminate the newly launched instance.
D. The cooldown period will be automatically extended.

Answer: B

Explanation: The cooldown period prevents the Auto Scaling group from initiating additional scaling activities (either out or in) immediately after a previous one. This allows time for the newly launched instances to come online and start affecting the metrics, preventing rapid, excessive scaling oscillations. Since the second alarm occurred within the 300-second period, it will be ignored.
---
Question #: 1010
Which Elastic Load Balancing feature allows you to route traffic to different backend applications (target groups) based on the URL path or the hostname in the request?

A. Cross-Zone Load Balancing
B. Sticky Sessions
C. Path-based and Host-based Routing
D. Health Checks

Answer: C

Explanation: This is a key feature of the Application Load Balancer (ALB). It operates at Layer 7 and can inspect the content of the HTTP request. This allows you to create listener rules that say, for example, "if the path is `/api/*`, send traffic to the API-servers target group" or "if the hostname is `images.example.com`, send traffic to the image-servers target group".

Question #: 1011
You are designing an application that requires a consistent user session, meaning a user should be directed to the same backend EC2 instance for the duration of their session. Which ELB feature enables this?

A. Access Logs
B. Connection Draining
C. Sticky Sessions (Session Affinity)
D. SSL Termination

Answer: C

Explanation: Sticky Sessions, also known as session affinity, is a feature that allows the load balancer to bind a user's session to a specific target instance. It does this by using a cookie. As long as the user's browser continues to present the cookie, the load balancer will route their requests to the same instance, which is necessary for applications that store session state locally.

Question #: 1012
An Auto Scaling group is configured to span three Availability Zones: us-east-1a, us-east-1b, and us-east-1c. Its desired capacity is 5. How will the Auto Scaling group distribute the instances?

A. It will place all 5 instances in us-east-1a.
B. It will place 1 instance in each AZ, and the remaining 2 in us-east-1a.
C. It will attempt to balance the instances as evenly as possible across the three AZs (e.g., 2 in one AZ, 2 in another, and 1 in the third).
D. It will place 2.5 instances in two of the AZs.

Answer: C

Explanation: A key function of an Auto Scaling group is to maintain availability by distributing instances across multiple AZs. When scaling, it will always try to keep the number of instances in each enabled AZ as balanced as possible to provide the greatest resilience to an AZ failure.
---
Question #: 1013
Which type of Auto Scaling policy is best for a workload that has a predictable, recurring traffic pattern, such as a business application that is busy during work hours and idle overnight?

A. Target Tracking Scaling
B. Simple Scaling
C. Step Scaling
D. Scheduled Scaling

Answer: D

Explanation: Scheduled Scaling is designed for predictable traffic patterns. You can create scheduled actions that change the minimum, maximum, and desired capacity of your Auto Scaling group at specific times. For example, you can schedule the group to scale out to 10 instances every weekday at 9 AM and scale in to 2 instances at 5 PM.
---
Question #: 1014
What is the purpose of "Cross-Zone Load Balancing" on a load balancer?

A. It allows the load balancer to distribute traffic across VPCs.
B. It ensures that traffic is distributed evenly across all registered instances in all enabled Availability Zones.
C. It balances the load between multiple load balancers.
D. It enables the load balancer to work with Auto Scaling.

Answer: B

Explanation: Without cross-zone load balancing, each load balancer node only distributes traffic to the instances within its own Availability Zone. If you have an uneven number of instances per AZ, this can lead to an imbalance of traffic. When you enable cross-zone load balancing, each load balancer node distributes traffic evenly across all instances in all AZs, providing a more uniform distribution. (Note: This is enabled by default for ALBs, but not for NLBs).
---
Question #: 1015
You need to perform maintenance on an EC2 instance that is part of an Auto Scaling group. You want to temporarily remove it from service without the Auto Scaling group terminating it. What should you do?

A. Stop the EC2 instance.
B. Place the instance into the "Standby" state.
C. Detach the instance from the Auto Scaling group.
D. Modify the instance's health check to fail.

Answer: B

Explanation: The "Standby" state is designed for this exact purpose. When you put an instance into Standby, the Auto Scaling group removes it from service (it's deregistered from the ELB) and suspends health checks on it. However, the instance is still part of the group and is not terminated. You can then perform your maintenance and return the instance to service when you are finished.
---
Question #: 1016
An Application Load Balancer is configured with a target group containing 5 EC2 instances. The health check is configured to require 3 consecutive successful checks to be considered healthy, and 3 consecutive failed checks to be considered unhealthy. An instance that was previously healthy fails two health checks, then passes one, then fails another. What is its state?

A. It will be marked as unhealthy.
B. It will remain in the healthy state.
C. It will be terminated by the load balancer.
D. Its state will be "draining".

Answer: B

Explanation: The instance will remain healthy because the threshold for being marked unhealthy (3 *consecutive* failures) was not met. The sequence of fail-fail-pass-fail did not include three failures in a row. The health check counter resets after each successful check.
---
Question #: 1017
Which of the following are valid lifecycle hooks for an Auto Scaling group? (Choose TWO)

A. `autoscaling:EC2_INSTANCE_LAUNCHING`
B. `autoscaling:EC2_INSTANCE_RUNNING`
C. `autoscaling:EC2_INSTANCE_STOPPING`
D. `autoscaling:EC2_INSTANCE_TERMINATING`
E. `autoscaling:EC2_INSTANCE_HEALTHY`

Answer: A, D

Explanation: Auto Scaling lifecycle hooks allow you to pause an instance as it is either being launched or being terminated, so you can perform custom actions. The two valid states for a lifecycle hook are `EC2_INSTANCE_LAUNCHING` (as it's being created) and `EC2_INSTANCE_TERMINATING` (as it's being shut down).
---
Question #: 1018
To ensure an application is highly available, you have deployed it across two AWS Regions: us-east-1 and us-west-2. How can you route traffic to the region with the lowest latency for each user, and also provide for automatic failover if one region becomes unavailable?

A. Use an Application Load Balancer with targets in both regions.
B. Use Amazon Route 53 with a Latency routing policy and configure health checks for the endpoints in each region.
C. Use an Auto Scaling group that can launch instances in both regions.
D. Use a VPC Peering connection between the two regional VPCs.

Answer: B

Explanation: This is a key use case for Amazon Route 53. A Latency routing policy directs users to the AWS endpoint (e.g., a load balancer) that provides the fastest response time from their location. By associating Route 53 health checks with each regional endpoint, Route 53 can detect if a region is down and will automatically stop sending traffic to the unhealthy endpoint, effectively failing over to the healthy region.
---
Question #: 1019
What is the "draining" state for an instance registered with an Application Load Balancer?

A. The instance has failed its health checks and is being terminated.
B. The instance is being deregistered, and the load balancer allows existing, in-flight requests to complete before it stops sending new requests.
C. The instance is in the process of being registered with the load balancer.
D. The instance is being patched by AWS Systems Manager.

Answer: B

Explanation: Connection Draining (or Deregistration Delay) is a process that ensures existing user sessions are not abruptly cut off when an instance is taken out of service (e.g., during a scale-in event or deployment). The ELB stops sending *new* requests to the instance but keeps the connections open for a configured period, allowing active requests to complete gracefully.
---
Question #: 1020
An Auto Scaling group's scaling policy is based on the SQS metric `ApproximateNumberOfMessagesVisible`. What is the likely purpose of this configuration?

A. To scale the number of web servers based on incoming traffic.
B. To scale a fleet of worker instances based on the number of jobs waiting in a queue.
C. To scale a database's read capacity.
D. To monitor the health of the SQS service.

Answer: B

Explanation: This is a common asynchronous processing pattern. An SQS queue holds jobs or messages to be processed. A fleet of worker instances (managed by an Auto Scaling group) pulls messages from the queue. By creating a scaling policy based on the number of messages in the queue, you can automatically add more worker instances when the backlog grows and remove them when the queue is empty, matching compute capacity to the workload.
---
Question #: 1021
Which type of load balancer uses "listeners", "rules", and "target groups" to define how traffic is routed?

A. Classic Load Balancer
B. Network Load Balancer
C. Application Load Balancer
D. Gateway Load Balancer

Answer: C

Explanation: The Application Load Balancer introduced a more flexible configuration model based on these components. A "listener" checks for connection requests on a specific port. Each listener has "rules" that evaluate the request. Based on the rule, the request is forwarded to a "target group," which is a collection of backend resources (like EC2 instances).
---
Question #: 1022
A company wants to ensure that its Auto Scaling group never has fewer than 2 instances running, even if the desired capacity is set to 1. Which setting should be configured?

A. Maximum Size = 2
B. Desired Capacity = 2
C. Minimum Size = 2
D. Health Check Grace Period = 120

Answer: C

Explanation: The minimum size is a hard floor for the Auto Scaling group. It will never terminate instances if doing so would bring the total number of running instances below the minimum size. The desired capacity is the target number, but it cannot be less than the minimum.
---
Question #: 1023
What does the term "scalability" mean in a cloud computing context?

A. The ability of a system to remain operational during a component failure.
B. The ability of a system to handle a growing amount of work by adding resources, or to shrink by removing resources.
C. The ability to access a system from anywhere in the world.
D. The ability to secure a system against attacks.

Answer: B

Explanation: Scalability refers to the system's ability to adjust its capacity to meet demand. This includes both "scaling up/out" (adding resources to handle increased load) and "scaling down/in" (removing resources to reduce costs when load decreases).
---
Question #: 1024
Which of the following is an example of "vertical scaling" or "scaling up"?

A. Adding more EC2 instances to an Auto Scaling group.
B. Increasing the EC2 instance size from a `t3.medium` to a `t3.xlarge`.
C. Distributing traffic across multiple Availability Zones.
D. Creating a read replica for an RDS database.

Answer: B

Explanation: Vertical scaling (scaling up) means increasing the resources of a single server, such as its CPU, memory, or storage. Changing the instance type to a more powerful one is a classic example. Adding more servers (A) is an example of horizontal scaling (scaling out).
---
Question #: 1025
An Auto Scaling group has a "health check grace period" of 300 seconds. What is the purpose of this setting?

A. It is the amount of time the group will wait before terminating an instance that has failed a health check.
B. It is the amount of time after an instance launches before Auto Scaling starts performing health checks on it.
C. It is the period during which scaling activities are paused after a scaling event.
D. It is the maximum time a health check can take to respond.

Answer: B

Explanation: The health check grace period is important because newly launched instances often need time to boot up their operating system and start their application services. This setting prevents Auto Scaling from prematurely terminating an instance for failing health checks before it has had a chance to become fully operational.
---
Question #: 1026
Which feature of an Application Load Balancer can be used to authenticate users before they access your application?

A. Integration with AWS WAF
B. Support for Sticky Sessions
C. Integration with Amazon Cognito or another OIDC-compliant identity provider.
D. Path-based routing

Answer: C

Explanation: An ALB can be configured to authenticate users for you. You can set up a listener rule with an "Authenticate" action that integrates with Amazon Cognito (or another OpenID Connect provider). The ALB will handle the user authentication flow (e.g., redirecting to a login page) and will only forward authenticated requests to your backend targets.
---
Question #: 1027
A solutions architect needs to deploy a critical application with a Recovery Time Objective (RTO) of less than 15 minutes and a Recovery Point Objective (RPO) of near zero. Which disaster recovery strategy does this describe?

A. Backup and Restore
B. Pilot Light
C. Warm Standby
D. Multi-site Active/Active

Answer: D

Explanation: An RTO of minutes and an RPO of seconds/zero implies a fully scaled, continuously running deployment in a second region that is actively serving traffic. This is a Multi-site (or Multi-region) Active/Active strategy. The other strategies involve bringing resources online after a disaster, which would result in a longer RTO.
---
Question #: 1028
What is a key benefit of designing a "stateless" application architecture for scalability?

A. It reduces the memory footprint of the application.
B. It allows any server to handle any request, making it easy to add or remove servers without losing user session data.
C. It improves the security of the application by not storing user data.
D. It eliminates the need for a database.

Answer: B

Explanation: In a stateless architecture, no user session data is stored on the web/application servers themselves. Session data is stored in a centralized location, like a database or a caching service (e.g., ElastiCache). This means any server in the fleet can process a request from any user, which makes horizontal scaling with a load balancer and Auto Scaling group simple and effective.
---
Question #: 1029
You have an Auto Scaling group with a simple scaling policy that adds 1 instance when CPU is > 70%. The policy has a cooldown period of 300 seconds. CPU spikes to 80%, and one instance is added. Four minutes later, CPU is still at 80%. What happens next?

A. Nothing, because the cooldown period is still in effect.
B. Another instance is added immediately.
C. The newly launched instance is terminated.
D. The simple scaling policy is disabled.

Answer: A

Explanation: A simple scaling policy has a cooldown period that starts after it successfully completes a scaling action. In this case, 300 seconds is 5 minutes. Since only four minutes have passed, the cooldown period is still active, and the policy will not be evaluated again until the period expires. This is a key reason why Step and Target Tracking policies are now preferred over Simple scaling.
---
Question #: 1030
Which load balancer type would you use to forward traffic directly to backend targets using their IP addresses, including targets in an on-premises location connected via AWS Direct Connect?

A. Application Load Balancer
B. Network Load Balancer
C. Classic Load Balancer
D. This is not possible with an ELB.

Answer: A

Explanation: An Application Load Balancer supports multiple target types, including "IP addresses". This allows you to register targets outside of the VPC where the ALB resides, such as EC2 instances in a peered VPC or on-premises servers whose IP addresses are reachable from the ALB's VPC (e.g., over a VPN or Direct Connect).
---
Question #: 1031
What is the "desired capacity" of an Auto Scaling group?

A. The maximum number of instances that can be running in the group.
B. The minimum number of instances that must be running in the group.
C. The number of instances that the Auto Scaling group attempts to maintain at all times.
D. The number of instances that are currently healthy.

Answer: C

Explanation: The desired capacity is the target number of instances for the group. Auto Scaling will launch or terminate instances as needed to maintain this number. Scaling policies work by modifying this desired capacity value up or down (within the min/max limits).
---
Question #: 1032
What is the purpose of an Auto Scaling group's "Termination Policy"?

A. It defines which instances should be terminated first during a scale-in event.
B. It defines the IAM policy for terminating instances.
C. It defines what happens to an instance's EBS volumes when it is terminated.
D. It is a policy that terminates the entire Auto Scaling group at a scheduled time.

Answer: A

Explanation: When an Auto Scaling group needs to scale in (reduce its size), it must choose which instance(s) to terminate. The termination policy provides the logic for this decision. The default policy tries to balance AZs, but you can choose other policies like "NewestInstance", "OldestInstance", or "OldestLaunchConfiguration".
---
Question #: 1033
An Application Load Balancer must listen for secure web traffic. What must be configured on the listener?

A. An IAM role with permissions to decrypt traffic.
B. A security group that allows port 443.
C. An SSL/TLS certificate.
D. A route table entry pointing to the backend instances.

Answer: C

Explanation: To create an HTTPS listener, you must provide an SSL/TLS certificate. The load balancer uses this certificate to terminate the secure connection from the client and decrypt the traffic. The easiest way to manage this is by using a certificate from AWS Certificate Manager (ACM).
---
Question #: 1034
An application requires extremely low latency and high throughput. The clients of the application use a non-HTTP protocol. Which load balancer is the best fit?

A. Application Load Balancer
B. Classic Load Balancer
C. Network Load Balancer
D. A custom load balancer on an EC2 instance.

Answer: C

Explanation: The Network Load Balancer (NLB) operates at the transport layer (Layer 4) and is optimized for high performance, handling millions of TCP/UDP requests per second with very low latency. Because it does not inspect application-level content, it is suitable for any TCP/UDP-based protocol, not just HTTP/S.
---
Question #: 1035
Which of the following is an example of "horizontal scaling" or "scaling out"?

A. Increasing the size of an EBS volume.
B. Changing an EC2 instance type from m5.large to m5.2xlarge.
C. Adding more EC2 instances to an Auto Scaling group.
D. Upgrading an RDS database instance to a more powerful class.

Answer: C

Explanation: Horizontal scaling (scaling out) means adding more individual machines (nodes) to a system to distribute the load. Adding more instances to an Auto Scaling group is the classic example of this. The other options are all examples of vertical scaling (scaling up).
---
Question #: 1036
What is an Auto Scaling group "lifecycle hook"?

A. A feature that allows you to pause an instance's launch or termination to perform custom actions.
B. A script that runs on an instance to report its health status.
C. A policy that terminates instances after a certain amount of time.
D. A hook that connects the Auto Scaling group to a third-party monitoring service.

Answer: A

Explanation: Lifecycle hooks give you a window of time to perform custom actions on an instance before it is fully put into service or before it is terminated. For example, during a launch hook, you could run a script to download configuration data or register the instance with a central directory. During a termination hook, you could run a script to safely drain connections or back up log files.
---
Question #: 1037
A website is served from an S3 bucket configured for static website hosting. How can you provide a custom domain name (e.g., `www.example.com`) and HTTPS for this website?

A. Use an Application Load Balancer in front of the S3 bucket.
B. Use Amazon Route 53 to point an A record to the S3 bucket's IP address.
C. Use Amazon CloudFront, configure the S3 bucket as the origin, and associate an ACM certificate with the distribution.
D. Assign an Elastic IP to the S3 bucket.

Answer: C

Explanation: The standard and best practice for serving a static S3 website over HTTPS with a custom domain is to use Amazon CloudFront. You create a CloudFront distribution, set the S3 bucket as the origin, and then attach your SSL certificate from AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) to the distribution. You then point your domain's DNS to the CloudFront distribution's domain name.
---
Question #: 1038
When an RDS database is configured for Multi-AZ, what kind of replication is used?

A. Asynchronous replication
B. Synchronous replication
C. Read-only replication
D. Cross-region replication

Answer: B

Explanation: RDS Multi-AZ uses synchronous replication. This means that when your application writes data to the primary database, the data is written to both the primary and the standby replica *before* the transaction is committed and acknowledged as successful. This ensures that the standby is always an exact, up-to-date copy, which allows for a very low Recovery Point Objective (RPO) in case of a failover.
---
Question #: 1039
A new instance is launched by an Auto Scaling group. It needs to download and install software, which takes about 5 minutes. The ELB health checks start after 1 minute and fail, causing the instance to be marked as unhealthy. What should be done?

A. Increase the "Deregistration Delay" on the ELB.
B. Increase the "Health Check Grace Period" on the Auto Scaling group.
C. Increase the "Cooldown Period" on the scaling policy.
D. Manually put the instance in the "Standby" state for 5 minutes.

Answer: B

Explanation: The Health Check Grace Period is designed for this scenario. By setting it to 300 seconds (5 minutes) or more, you tell the Auto Scaling group to wait for that period of time before it starts considering the ELB health check status for the new instance. This gives the instance enough time to complete its bootup and configuration tasks.
---
Question #: 1040
You have a fleet of web servers behind an Application Load Balancer. You want to deploy a new version of your application with zero downtime. What is a common strategy to achieve this?

A. Stop all the old instances at once and start all the new ones.
B. Use a Blue/Green deployment strategy, where you deploy the new version to a separate, parallel environment and then cut over traffic.
C. Detach the instances from the ALB, update them, and then re-attach them.
D. Use a scheduled scaling action to replace the instances overnight.

Answer: B

Explanation: Blue/Green deployment is a popular strategy for minimizing downtime. You have your current production environment ("Blue"). You deploy the new application version to a completely separate, identical environment ("Green"). After testing the Green environment, you can switch traffic from Blue to Green (e.g., by updating DNS or ALB listener rules). This allows for instant cutover and quick rollback if issues are found.
---
Question #: 1041
Which Auto Scaling scaling policy provides the most responsive and hands-off approach to managing capacity based on a metric like CPU utilization or request count?

A. Simple Scaling
B. Step Scaling
C. Scheduled Scaling
D. Target Tracking Scaling

Answer: D

Explanation: Target Tracking is designed to be the simplest and most effective scaling method. You simply choose a metric and set a target value (e.g., "keep average CPU at 40%"). Auto Scaling then automatically calculates how many instances to add or remove to keep the metric at or near the target value, removing the need for you to define specific step adjustments.
---
Question #: 1042
When using Amazon RDS Multi-AZ, can you connect to the standby replica for read operations?

A. Yes, it acts as a read replica to reduce load on the primary.
B. No, the standby replica cannot be used to serve traffic and is only used for failover.
C. Yes, but only if you are connecting from within the same Availability Zone.
D. No, unless you manually promote it to be the primary.

Answer: B

Explanation: A key distinction of the Multi-AZ feature is that the standby instance is a "hot standby" purely for high availability. It is not a read replica. It cannot be connected to or used to serve any read or write traffic. To scale read traffic, you need to create separate Read Replicas.
---
Question #: 1043
What is the "warm-up" period in the context of a target tracking Auto Scaling policy?

A. The time it takes for an instance to boot up.
B. The estimated time, in seconds, until a newly launched instance can start contributing to the CloudWatch metrics.
C. The cooldown period after a scale-in event.
D. The time required for the load balancer to warm up its capacity.

Answer: B

Explanation: When using target tracking, you can specify an instance warm-up period. This tells the scaling policy how long a new instance will take before it starts contributing to the aggregate metric (e.g., CPU, Request Count). The policy will not count the metrics from instances still in their warm-up period, which prevents the group from scaling out too aggressively based on skewed averages.
---
Question #: 1044
Which component of an Application Load Balancer can inspect a custom HTTP header and route traffic based on its value?

A. The Target Group
B. The Listener Rule
C. The Health Check
D. The Security Group

Answer: B

Explanation: The Listener Rule is the component that provides advanced, content-based routing. You can create a rule that inspects various parts of the HTTP request, including the path, hostname, query string, and custom headers, and then forwards the request to a specific target group based on the value it finds.
---
Question #: 1045
An Auto Scaling group is set to launch instances into three subnets, each in a different Availability Zone. One of the Availability Zones experiences a power outage. What is the expected behavior of the Auto Scaling group?

A. The entire Auto Scaling group will fail and stop launching instances.
B. The group will automatically stop trying to launch instances into the failed AZ and will continue to launch instances into the remaining healthy AZs.
C. The group will terminate all existing instances in the healthy AZs.
D. You must manually remove the subnet from the failed AZ from the group's configuration.

Answer: B

Explanation: Auto Scaling is designed to be resilient to AZ failures. If it is unable to launch an instance into a specific AZ (e.g., due to an outage or capacity constraints), it will automatically try to launch in the other configured AZs to meet the desired capacity. It will continue retrying in the failed AZ periodically.
---
Question #: 1046
You are designing a system to process a large number of video files asynchronously. The number of files to process can vary dramatically. What is the most scalable and cost-effective architecture?

A. A single, very large EC2 instance that polls a directory for new files.
B. An S3 bucket for video uploads, an SQS queue to hold processing jobs, and a fleet of EC2 worker instances in an Auto Scaling group.
C. A fleet of EC2 instances behind a Network Load Balancer.
D. An EC2 instance that writes job metadata to an RDS database.

Answer: B

Explanation: This is a classic "decoupled" architecture for scalability. Uploading files to S3 triggers an event (e.g., via S3 Event Notifications) that places a message in an SQS queue. The Auto Scaling group of worker instances can then scale out based on the number of messages in the queue, ensuring you have just enough compute power to process the current workload, and scales in to save money when there are no jobs.
---
Question #: 1047
What does it mean for an architecture to be "loosely coupled"?

A. The components of the architecture are all running on the same server.
B. The components are designed so that a change or failure in one component has minimal impact on the others.
C. The components communicate directly with each other over synchronous API calls.
D. All components are deployed in the same Availability Zone.

Answer: B

Explanation: Loose coupling is a key principle of scalable and resilient design. It means that components are independent. They often communicate asynchronously, for example through a message queue like SQS. If the component that processes messages fails, the component that sends messages can continue to operate and place messages on the queue, and they will be processed when the other component recovers.
---
Question #: 1048
Which AWS service allows you to use your own domain name (e.g., `www.example.com`) to route users to your AWS resources, such as a load balancer or a CloudFront distribution?

A. Amazon VPC
B. AWS Direct Connect
C. Amazon Route 53
D. Elastic Load Balancing

Answer: C

Explanation: Amazon Route 53 is AWS's highly available and scalable Domain Name System (DNS) web service. You use it to register domain names and, most importantly, to create DNS records (like A records, CNAME records, or Alias records) that translate your friendly domain name into the IP address or hostname of your AWS resources.
---
Question #: 1049
You have an Auto Scaling group with a minimum size of 2 and a maximum of 10. The current desired capacity is 4. You manually change the desired capacity to 1. What will happen?

A. Auto Scaling will terminate 3 instances.
B. Auto Scaling will terminate 2 instances, as the minimum size is 2.
C. The change will be rejected because the desired capacity cannot be set below the minimum.
D. Auto Scaling will do nothing.

Answer: B

Explanation: The desired capacity cannot be less than the minimum size. If you attempt to set the desired capacity to a value lower than the minimum, the Auto Scaling group will adjust the desired capacity up to the minimum size value. In this case, since you set it to 1 and the minimum is 2, the group will set the desired capacity to 2 and terminate 2 instances to reach that new target.
*Correction:* The API or console would prevent you from setting the desired capacity below the minimum. A more accurate statement is that the operation would fail. However, in the logic of what ASG enforces, it respects the minimum. Let's re-evaluate the most likely exam answer. The ASG will not allow the `desired` to go below `min`. If you try to update the ASG and set `desired=1` when `min=2`, the API call itself will fail. So the ASG does nothing because the attempted change is invalid.

Answer: C

Explanation: The constraints of an Auto Scaling group require that `min <= desired <= max`. If you try to update the configuration to set the desired capacity to a value lower than the minimum size, the API call will fail with an error. The Auto Scaling group will take no action and the desired capacity will remain at 4.
---
Question #: 1050
Which load balancer feature allows you to host multiple HTTPS applications, each with its own SSL certificate, on a single listener?

A. Cross-Zone Load Balancing
B. Server Name Indication (SNI)
C. Sticky Sessions
D. Path-based routing

Answer: B

Explanation: Server Name Indication (SNI) is a feature that allows the client to indicate which hostname it is attempting to connect to at the start of the SSL/TLS handshake. The Application Load Balancer supports SNI, which allows you to associate multiple certificates with a single secure listener. The ALB will then present the correct certificate to the client based on the requested hostname.
---
Question #: 1051
A "Step Scaling" policy is configured with the following steps:
- If CPU is between 50% and 75%, add 1 instance.
- If CPU is >= 75%, add 3 instances.
The current average CPU is 80%. How many instances will be added?

A. 1
B. 2
C. 3
D. 4

Answer: C

Explanation: A step scaling policy allows you to define different scaling responses for different ranges of a metric. Since the current CPU of 80% falls into the ">= 75%" range, the corresponding action will be taken, which is to add 3 instances.
---
Question #: 1052
What is a primary use case for a Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB)?

A. To distribute HTTP/S traffic to a fleet of web servers.
B. To distribute TCP traffic to backend services requiring a static IP.
C. To deploy, scale, and manage a fleet of third-party virtual network appliances like firewalls, IDS/IPS, and deep packet inspection systems.
D. To balance traffic between multiple AWS regions.

Answer: C

Explanation: The Gateway Load Balancer is a specialized service designed to make it easier to insert virtual appliances into the network path. It acts as a transparent "bump-in-the-wire," forwarding all traffic to a fleet of security appliances for inspection before sending it on to its original destination, without the need for complex routing changes.
---
Question #: 1053
An Auto Scaling group is not launching new instances when the scale-out alarm is triggered. The ASG's activity history shows an error: "The requested configuration is currently not supported." What is a likely cause?

A. The IAM role for the Auto Scaling group is missing permissions.
B. The specified AMI ID in the launch template has been deregistered.
C. The requested EC2 instance type is not available in any of the selected Availability Zones.
D. The cooldown period for the scaling policy is too long.

Answer: C

Explanation: This error message often indicates a capacity or availability issue. If you have requested an instance type that is not currently available in any of the AZs configured for your Auto Scaling group, the launch request will fail. This could be due to a general capacity constraint in the region or because the instance type is not offered in that specific AZ.

Question #: 1054
Which of the following describes a "Pilot Light" disaster recovery strategy?

A. A fully scaled, active deployment running in a second region.
B. A minimal version of the core infrastructure (e.g., the database and a small application server) is kept running in a second region.
C. Only the data is backed up to a second region.
D. A copy of the application's AMI is stored in a second region.

Answer: B

Explanation: In a Pilot Light strategy, you replicate your data to the DR region and maintain a small, minimal version of your core infrastructure. For example, the database is running, but the application servers are either turned off or running on a very small scale. In a disaster, you would "light" the pilot by scaling up the application servers and cutting over DNS. This offers a faster RTO than Backup and Restore but is less expensive than Warm Standby.

Question #: 1055
You have an Application Load Balancer with a target group of EC2 instances. The "slow start" mode is enabled for the target group with a duration of 90 seconds. What is the effect of this?

A. The ALB will wait 90 seconds before sending any traffic to a newly registered instance.
B. The ALB will gradually increase the amount of traffic it sends to a newly registered instance over a 90-second period.
C. New instances will have a health check grace period of 90 seconds.
D. The ALB will drain connections for 90 seconds before deregistering an instance.

Answer: B

Explanation: Slow start mode is designed to prevent a newly registered instance from being overwhelmed with a flood of requests before its caches are warmed up and it's ready for full load. When an instance becomes healthy, the ALB will slowly ramp up the share of traffic it sends to that instance over the configured warm-up period.
---
Question #: 1056
For a stateful application that requires a specific instance to handle all requests from a user, which load balancer and feature should be used?

A. Network Load Balancer with Source IP affinity.
B. Application Load Balancer with duration-based sticky sessions.
C. Classic Load Balancer with session draining.
D. Gateway Load Balancer with a custom cookie.

Answer: B

Explanation: The Application Load Balancer supports sticky sessions using load balancer-generated cookies. This is the standard way to handle session affinity for HTTP/S applications. A Network Load Balancer (A) can use source IP affinity, but this can be problematic if multiple users are behind a single corporate NAT.
---
Question #: 1057
What is the relationship between an Auto Scaling group and an Elastic Load Balancer?

A. An Auto Scaling group must always be attached to a load balancer.
B. A load balancer must always have an Auto Scaling group as its target.
C. They are independent services, but they are often used together to create a scalable and highly available application.
D. An Auto Scaling group is a type of load balancer.

Answer: C

Explanation: While they are designed to work together and are a very common architectural pattern, they are fundamentally separate services. You can attach an Auto Scaling group to an ELB's target group so new instances are automatically registered. However, you can also use an Auto Scaling group without a load balancer (e.g., for a fleet of background processing workers) or use a load balancer with a fixed set of manually registered instances.
---
Question #: 1058
Which AWS service can be used to create a highly available and self-healing infrastructure for a containerized application running on Amazon ECS or EKS?

A. Elastic Load Balancing
B. Amazon Route 53
C. AWS Auto Scaling
D. A and C

Answer: D

Explanation: For a containerized application, you would use both. AWS Auto Scaling can be used to scale the number of container tasks (the application) and also the number of EC2 instances in the underlying cluster. An Elastic Load Balancer (typically an ALB) would then be used to distribute incoming traffic across the running container tasks, providing a stable endpoint and high availability.
---
Question #: 1059
You need to create a copy of your production environment for testing. The environment consists of an ELB, an Auto Scaling group, and an RDS database. What is the most efficient way to duplicate this infrastructure?

A. Manually create each resource in the new environment.
B. Use AWS CloudFormation to define the infrastructure as code and deploy a new stack from the template.
C. Create AMIs of the EC2 instances and snapshots of the RDS database and manually restore them.
D. Use AWS DataSync to copy the resources.

Answer: B

Explanation: AWS CloudFormation is the Infrastructure as Code (IaC) service that allows you to model and provision your AWS resources in a repeatable and automated way. By defining your entire application stack in a CloudFormation template, you can easily and reliably deploy identical copies of it for different environments (dev, test, prod) or for disaster recovery.
---
Question #: 1060
An Auto Scaling group is configured to use the `ELB` health check type. An instance in the group is passing its EC2 system status checks but is failing its ELB health checks. What will the Auto Scaling group do?

A. Do nothing, because the EC2 status check is passing.
B. Mark the instance as unhealthy and terminate it.
C. Stop the instance but do not terminate it.
D. Detach the instance from the group.

Answer: B

Explanation: When you configure an Auto Scaling group to use `ELB` health checks, it considers the instance's health to be the result of the load balancer's health check, in addition to the EC2 status checks. If the ELB reports the instance as unhealthy (e.g., because the application is not responding), the Auto Scaling group will also consider it unhealthy and will proceed to terminate and replace it.
---
Question #: 1061
Which of the following is NOT a valid target for an Application Load Balancer?

A. EC2 instances
B. IP addresses
C. Lambda functions
D. Another Application Load Balancer

Answer: D

Explanation: An Application Load Balancer can route traffic to EC2 instances, IP addresses (including on-premises servers), and Lambda functions. However, you cannot directly target another load balancer. Chaining load balancers is generally an anti-pattern, although specific architectures might place an NLB in front of an ALB for certain use cases.
---
Question #: 1062
When designing a multi-AZ architecture, what is a key benefit of using an Elastic IP address?

A. It allows you to have more than one public IP on an instance.
B. It provides a static, public IP address that can be remapped to a healthy instance in another AZ during a failover.
C. It encrypts all traffic to the instance.
D. It reduces the cost of data transfer.

Answer: B

Explanation: An Elastic IP is a static public IP that is tied to your account, not a specific instance. In a failover scenario (e.g., for a single-instance database or a stateful server), you can programmatically disassociate the Elastic IP from the failed instance in one AZ and re-associate it with a standby instance in another AZ, allowing you to quickly redirect traffic without DNS changes.
---
Question #: 1063
An Auto Scaling group launches a new instance. What is the initial health status of the instance?

A. Healthy
B. Unhealthy
C. Pending
D. Draining

Answer: C

Explanation: When a new instance is launched, it enters the `Pending` state. The Auto Scaling group waits for the instance to be fully configured and running. It will remain in `Pending` until either the health check grace period expires (at which point it starts being checked) or a lifecycle hook is completed. Once it passes its first health check, it enters the `InService` state.
---
Question #: 1064
What is the purpose of an AWS Auto Scaling "scheduled action"?

A. To schedule the termination of a specific EC2 instance.
B. To predictably scale your application in response to known, recurring traffic patterns.
C. To schedule a health check to run at a specific time.
D. To create a snapshot of the group's instances on a schedule.

Answer: B

Explanation: Scheduled actions are used for proactive scaling based on time. If you know your traffic increases every morning at 9 AM and decreases at 5 PM, you can create scheduled actions to change the group's desired, min, and max capacities at those times, ensuring capacity is ready before the load arrives.
---
Question #: 1065
What is the key difference between an RDS Multi-AZ deployment and an RDS Read Replica?

A. Multi-AZ is for high availability (disaster recovery), while Read Replicas are for scalability (performance).
B. Multi-AZ uses asynchronous replication, while Read Replicas use synchronous replication.
C. You can connect to a Multi-AZ standby for reads, but not a Read Replica.
D. Multi-AZ can be in a different region, while Read Replicas must be in the same region.

Answer: A

Explanation: This is the primary distinction. The Multi-AZ feature creates a standby replica for failover to improve availability. Read Replicas are created to offload read traffic from the primary database, thereby improving the performance and scalability of read-heavy applications.
---
Question #: 1066
An Application Load Balancer listener rule has a "fixed response" action configured. What does this do?

A. It forwards the request to a fixed, hardcoded IP address.
B. It responds to the client with a static, pre-defined HTTP response code and an optional message body, without forwarding the request to any target.
C. It always routes the request to the same target instance.
D. It responds with the health check status of the target group.

Answer: B

Explanation: A fixed-response action is useful for responding to requests that you don't want to process. For example, you could create a rule that matches requests from a blocked user agent and configure a fixed response of "403 Forbidden". The ALB will generate and send this response directly to the client.
---
Question #: 1067
What does the "Rebalance" process in an Auto Scaling group do?

A. It ensures that the IAM permissions for the group are balanced.
B. It attempts to redistribute the number of running instances evenly across the configured Availability Zones.
C. It re-evaluates the scaling policies for the group.
D. It terminates the oldest instances and launches new ones.

Answer: B

Explanation: The rebalance activity is triggered when the AZs for your group become unbalanced (e.g., after an AZ outage is resolved and comes back online). The Auto Scaling group will launch new instances in the under-utilized AZs and terminate instances in the over-utilized AZs to restore an even distribution.
---
Question #: 1068
You have a fleet of EC2 instances behind a Network Load Balancer. You want to see the original IP address of the client making the request on your backend instances. What must be enabled?

A. Proxy Protocol v2 on the NLB's target group.
B. The `X-Forwarded-For` header in the NLB listener.
C. Sticky sessions on the target group.
D. Access Logs on the NLB.

Answer: A

Explanation: Because a Network Load Balancer operates at Layer 4, it does not add HTTP headers like `X-Forwarded-For`. To preserve the client's source IP address, you need to enable Proxy Protocol (version 2) on the target group. The NLB will then add a Proxy Protocol header to the TCP request, which your backend application can parse to get the original client IP.
---
Question #: 1069
An Auto Scaling group fails to launch an instance. The instance immediately terminates with the status "Client.InternalError". What should you investigate first?

A. The availability of the chosen instance type in the region.
B. The IAM permissions of the user who configured the Auto Scaling group.
C. The configuration of the launch template, specifically looking for issues like an invalid key pair, a non-existent security group, or an incorrect IAM instance profile.
D. The Network ACLs of the chosen subnets.

Answer: C

Explanation: An internal error during launch often points to a misconfiguration in the launch template or launch configuration. Common causes include referencing a resource that has been deleted (like a security group or key pair), specifying an IAM instance profile that doesn't exist, or having an incorrect block device mapping.
---
Question #: 1070
Which of the following describes the "Warm Standby" disaster recovery strategy?

A. A fully scaled version of the application is running in a DR region, actively taking traffic.
B. Only data is backed up to the DR region; infrastructure must be provisioned during a disaster.
C. A scaled-down, but fully functional, version of the application is running in the DR region.
D. The infrastructure is defined in code, but no resources are running in the DR region.

Answer: C

Explanation: Warm Standby is a middle ground between Pilot Light and Multi-Site Active/Active. In this strategy, a smaller, scaled-down version of the full production environment is always running in the disaster recovery region. During a failover, the first step is to scale up this "warm" environment to handle the full production load before redirecting traffic.
---
Question #: 1071
You have an Application Load Balancer with two target groups: TG-A and TG-B. You want to send 90% of the traffic to TG-A and 10% to TG-B for canary testing. What feature do you use?

A. Path-based routing
B. Host-based routing
C. A listener rule with a "forward" action that has weighted target groups.
D. A redirect action.

Answer: C

Explanation: The "forward" action in an ALB listener rule can be configured to distribute traffic to multiple target groups, each with a specific weight. This is the mechanism used for performing weighted routing, which is ideal for canary deployments and A/B testing.
---
Question #: 1072
An Auto Scaling group is configured to use both EC2 and ELB health checks. What happens if an instance fails its EC2 status check but passes its ELB health check?

A. The instance is considered healthy.
B. The instance is considered unhealthy.
C. The instance is put into the Standby state.
D. The ELB health check is ignored.

Answer: B

Explanation: The Auto Scaling group considers an instance unhealthy if it fails *either* the EC2 status checks *or* the ELB health checks (if ELB checks are enabled for the group). Since the EC2 check failed, the instance will be marked as unhealthy and scheduled for termination and replacement.
---
Question #: 1073
What is the primary architectural benefit of decoupling application components with a service like Amazon SQS?

A. It reduces the cost of EC2 instances.
B. It improves availability and scalability by allowing components to fail and scale independently.
C. It encrypts all data in transit between the components.
D. It simplifies the application code.

Answer: B

Explanation: Decoupling with a queue creates resilience. If the consumer component fails, the producer component can continue to place messages on the queue. When the consumer recovers, it can pick up where it left off. It also allows for independent scaling; if the queue gets long, you can scale out the number of consumers without affecting the producers.
---
Question #: 1074
You need to provide a single, static public IP address as an entry point for a fleet of EC2 instances that scales up and down. Which service combination achieves this?

A. An Application Load Balancer
B. An Auto Scaling group with a launch template that specifies an Elastic IP.
C. A Network Load Balancer with an Elastic IP address associated with it.
D. Amazon Route 53 with a failover routing policy.

Answer: C

Explanation: A Network Load Balancer is the only type of ELB that can be directly associated with an Elastic IP address, providing a stable, unchanging public IP for your application endpoint. This is a common requirement when third parties need to whitelist your application's IP address in their firewalls.
---
Question #: 1075
What is the default termination policy for an Auto Scaling group?

A. Terminate the newest instance first.
B. Terminate the oldest instance first.
C. Terminate instances at random.
D. Prioritize balancing instances across Availability Zones, then terminate based on the oldest launch configuration/template.

Answer: D

Explanation: The default policy is designed to maintain high availability. It first looks to see if any AZ has a disproportionately high number of instances and will terminate one there to even things out. If all AZs are balanced, it will find the instance that was launched from the oldest launch configuration or template and terminate it.
---
Question #: 1076
For an internet-facing Application Load Balancer, what is required to be configured in the VPC?

A. A NAT Gateway in each AZ.
B. At least two public subnets, each in a different Availability Zone.
C. A VPC Endpoint for the ELB service.
D. A Direct Connect gateway.

Answer: B

Explanation: To be highly available, an internet-facing load balancer must be able to deploy nodes in multiple Availability Zones. Therefore, you must select at least two subnets for the load balancer, and these subnets must be in different AZs. For an internet-facing ELB, these must also be public subnets (i.e., they have a route to an Internet Gateway).
---
Question #: 1077
Which of the following is a good use case for an Auto Scaling lifecycle hook?

A. To send an SNS notification when an instance is terminated.
B. To download application code or log files from an instance just before it is terminated.
C. To check the health of an instance.
D. To change the instance type of a running instance.

Answer: B

Explanation: A termination lifecycle hook pauses the termination process, giving you time to execute a script on the instance. This is commonly used to safely shut down an application, drain connections, or copy important stateful data (like logs) off the instance to a persistent store like S3 before the instance is permanently deleted.
---
Question #: 1078
Which Route 53 routing policy would you use to distribute traffic to multiple resources in proportions that you specify (e.g., 80% to one endpoint and 20% to another)?

A. Simple routing
B. Latency-based routing
C. Geolocation routing
D. Weighted routing

Answer: D

Explanation: Weighted routing lets you associate a weight with each record in a set. Route 53 will then route traffic to the resources based on these weights. For example, if you have two records with weights of 80 and 20, Route 53 will send approximately 80% of the traffic to the first resource and 20% to the second. This is useful for A/B testing and canary releases.
---
Question #: 1079
You have an Auto Scaling group with a desired capacity of 5. You place one of the instances into the Standby state. What does the Auto Scaling group do?

A. It terminates the Standby instance.
B. It does nothing; the group now runs with 4 active instances.
C. It launches a new instance to replace the one in Standby, bringing the active count back to 5.
D. It places all other instances into the Standby state as well.

Answer: C

Explanation: When an instance enters the Standby state, it is no longer considered part of the active, in-service fleet. The Auto Scaling group's primary goal is to maintain the desired capacity of *active* instances. Therefore, it will launch a new instance to compensate for the one that was put on standby.
---
Question #: 1080
Which type of ELB health check is most effective for determining the health of a web application?

A. A TCP ping to port 80.
B. An ICMP ping to the instance.
C. An HTTP GET request to a specific status page (e.g., `/healthcheck.html`) that is expected to return a 200 OK status code.
D. Checking the EC2 instance status.

Answer: C

Explanation: An HTTP-level health check is more comprehensive than a simple TCP or ICMP ping. It verifies not only that the instance is reachable and the webserver process is running, but also that the application itself is responsive and not stuck in a failed state. If the health check page fails to return a 200 OK, the instance is considered unhealthy.
---
Question #: 1081
To improve the availability of an application, you have deployed it to two AWS regions. In the event of a regional disaster, you want to manually fail over traffic to the secondary region. Which Route 53 routing policy is best for this active-passive scenario?

A. Latency-based routing
B. Weighted routing
C. Failover routing
D. Geolocation routing

Answer: C

Explanation: Failover routing is designed for active-passive disaster recovery. You configure a primary endpoint and a secondary endpoint. Route 53 continuously monitors the health of the primary endpoint using health checks. As long as the primary is healthy, all traffic is sent there. If the health checks for the primary fail, Route 53 will automatically start routing all traffic to the secondary endpoint.
---
Question #: 1082
You want to scale your Auto Scaling group based on the number of requests per minute each instance is handling. What type of scaling policy should you use?

A. Scheduled Scaling
B. Step Scaling based on the `NetworkIn` metric.
C. Target Tracking Scaling based on the `RequestCountPerTarget` metric from your Application Load Balancer.
D. Simple Scaling based on the `CPUUtilization` metric.

Answer: C

Explanation: The Application Load Balancer publishes a `RequestCountPerTarget` metric to CloudWatch. This metric is perfect for a Target Tracking policy. You can set a target value (e.g., "I want each instance to handle 1000 requests per minute"), and the Auto Scaling group will automatically add or remove instances to keep the actual value close to your target.
---
Question #: 1083
Which of the following services are "globally" resilient by default, not tied to a single region? (Choose TWO)

A. Amazon EC2
B. Amazon S3
C. AWS IAM
D. Amazon Route 53
E. Amazon RDS

Answer: C, D

Explanation: IAM and Route 53 are global services. IAM users, groups, and roles are not tied to a specific region. Route 53's DNS resolution is served from a global network of edge locations. Most other services, including EC2, S3, and RDS, are regional resources. While S3 is highly durable within a region, a bucket itself exists in a single specified region.
---
Question #: 1084
An Auto Scaling group is configured to launch instances into a private subnet. These instances need to download a bootstrap script from an S3 bucket upon launch. The VPC has no NAT Gateway. What must be configured for the launch to succeed?

A. An Internet Gateway attached to the VPC.
B. An Elastic IP address for each instance.
C. A Gateway VPC Endpoint for S3 in the VPC.
D. A VPC Peering connection to another VPC that has internet access.

Answer: C

Explanation: For an instance in a private subnet to access S3 without going over the public internet, you must configure a Gateway VPC Endpoint for S3. This creates a private route from your VPC directly to the S3 service, allowing the instances to download the script without needing a NAT Gateway or public IPs.
---
Question #: 1085
An Application Load Balancer has a rule that forwards traffic to a target group. This target group contains a Lambda function as its target. What happens when the rule is matched?

A. The ALB sends an HTTP request to the Lambda function's public endpoint.
B. The ALB invokes the Lambda function synchronously, and the function's response is returned as the HTTP response to the client.
C. The ALB sends an asynchronous event to the Lambda function.
D. This configuration is not valid.

Answer: B

Explanation: An ALB can directly invoke a Lambda function as a target. When a request matches a rule pointing to a Lambda target group, the ALB invokes the function synchronously. The body of the HTTP request is passed as the event payload to the function. The Lambda function's return value is then transformed into an HTTP response and sent back to the original client.
---
Question #: 1086
What is the "Elastic" in Elastic Load Balancing referring to?

A. The ability to stretch the load balancer across multiple AWS accounts.
B. The fact that it can handle any type of network protocol.
C. The ability of the load balancer to automatically scale its own capacity up and down in response to traffic patterns.
D. The flexible pricing model of the service.

Answer: C

Explanation: The "Elastic" in ELB (and many other AWS services) refers to its ability to scale automatically. You do not need to provision a specific size for your load balancer. AWS manages its underlying capacity and will scale it seamlessly in the background to handle the amount of traffic your application is receiving.
---
Question #: 1087
A company has a stateful application that cannot be easily horizontally scaled. During periods of high load, the single EC2 instance running the application becomes overwhelmed. What is the simplest way to improve the performance during these periods?

A. Deploy the application in a Multi-AZ Auto Scaling group.
B. Manually or automatically perform vertical scaling by stopping the instance, changing its instance type to a larger one, and restarting it.
C. Place the instance behind a Network Load Balancer.
D. Create a read replica of the instance.

Answer: B

Explanation: For a stateful application that cannot scale horizontally (by adding more instances), the only option is to scale vertically (make the single instance more powerful). This can be done by changing its instance type. While this involves downtime, it's the most direct way to increase the capacity for this type of application.
---
Question #: 1088
Which of the following is a primary driver for adopting a Multi-Region disaster recovery strategy?

A. To improve application latency for a global user base.
B. To protect against the failure or unavailability of an entire AWS Region.
C. To reduce the cost of data transfer.
D. To simplify the application architecture.

Answer: B

Explanation: While a multi-region deployment can also improve latency (A), its primary purpose in a DR context is business continuity. A multi-AZ architecture protects you from failures within a region, but a multi-region architecture is designed to protect you from large-scale events (like natural disasters or widespread outages) that could impact an entire region.
---
Question #: 1089
An Auto Scaling group is configured to use a launch template that specifies a Windows AMI. You need to update the fleet to use a new, patched Windows AMI. What is the most graceful way to do this with minimal disruption?

A. Create a new launch template with the new AMI and use an instance refresh to perform a rolling replacement of the instances.
B. Terminate all the old instances at once; the ASG will launch new ones from the updated template.
C. Manually launch new instances and then stop the old ones.
D. Update the existing launch template with the new AMI; existing instances will update automatically.

Answer: A

Explanation: The "Instance Refresh" feature is designed for this exact scenario. After you create a new version of your launch template with the new AMI, you start an instance refresh. The Auto Scaling group will then perform a rolling update, terminating old instances and launching new ones in a controlled manner (respecting health checks and optional warm-up periods) until the entire fleet is running the new version.
---
Question #: 1090
You have a Network Load Balancer with listeners for both TCP port 80 and TLS (TCP) port 443. How is TLS termination handled?

A. The NLB terminates the TLS connection and forwards unencrypted traffic to the targets.
B. The NLB passes the encrypted traffic directly to the targets, and the targets are responsible for TLS termination.
C. The NLB uses a certificate from AWS Certificate Manager to handle TLS.
D. The NLB redirects all TLS traffic to an Application Load Balancer.

Answer: B

Explanation: A key feature of the Network Load Balancer is that it operates at Layer 4. For TLS traffic, it performs passthrough. It does not terminate the TLS connection itself. The encrypted traffic is forwarded directly to the backend targets, which must have the SSL/TLS certificate installed and be configured to perform the decryption. (Note: NLB has added the ability to do TLS termination, but its primary mode and distinction from ALB is passthrough).
---
Question #: 1091
What is the primary purpose of Amazon ElastiCache in a scalable web application architecture?

A. To act as the primary database for the application.
B. To provide a managed, in-memory cache to reduce latency and offload requests from backend databases like RDS or DynamoDB.
C. To cache static files like images and CSS.
D. To provide DNS caching.

Answer: B

Explanation: ElastiCache (supporting Redis or Memcached) is an in-memory data store. Its primary use case is to cache frequently accessed data that would otherwise be retrieved from a slower, disk-based database. By serving reads from the fast in-memory cache, you can significantly improve application performance and reduce the load on your primary database, allowing it to scale more effectively.
---
Question #: 1092
An Auto Scaling group is set with a desired capacity of 2. Both instances are healthy. You suspend the "Launch" scaling process for the group. Then, you manually terminate one of the two running instances. What will happen?

A. The Auto Scaling group will launch a new instance to replace the terminated one.
B. The Auto Scaling group will do nothing, and the group will continue to run with only 1 instance.
C. The Auto Scaling group will terminate the remaining instance.
D. The "Launch" process will be automatically resumed.

Answer: B

Explanation: Suspending a specific scaling process allows you to isolate a part of the Auto Scaling group's functionality. By suspending the "Launch" process, you have explicitly told the group not to launch any new instances under any circumstances. Therefore, even though the desired capacity is 2 and the current count is 1, it will not launch a replacement for the terminated instance.
---
Question #: 1093
For a global application, you want to route users to the endpoint that is geographically closest to them to minimize latency. If a user is in a location with no specific record, you want to route them to a default endpoint. Which Route 53 routing policy combination achieves this?

A. A combination of Geolocation and Simple routing.
B. A combination of Geolocation and Failover routing.
C. A combination of Geolocation and Latency routing.
D. A combination of Geolocation and Weighted routing.

Answer: B

Explanation: This is a common pattern. You use Geolocation routing to create specific records for different continents or countries. You also create a "default" record (with location `*`). This default record can be a Failover record set. This way, users from defined locations go to their specific endpoints, and everyone else is directed to the default record. A better answer might be just a default `*` record in Geolocation. Let's reconsider.

Answer: A

Explanation: Geolocation routing allows you to create records for specific geographic locations (e.g., a record for Europe, a record for North America). You can also create a default record by setting the location to "*". This default record will be used for any user whose location does not match one of the more specific records. This is a form of Simple routing applied as the default case.

Question #: 1094
Which of the following is a managed, highly available, and scalable solution for running a relational database on AWS?

A. Running a self-managed MySQL server on an EC2 instance.
B. Amazon DynamoDB
C. Amazon RDS
D. Amazon S3

Answer: C

Explanation: Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service) is the managed service for relational databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, etc. It automates time-consuming administration tasks such as hardware provisioning, database setup, patching, and backups. Its Multi-AZ feature provides a simple way to achieve high availability.
---
Question #: 1095
An Auto Scaling group is configured to launch instances from a custom AMI. The application code is baked into the AMI. To deploy a new version of the code, a new AMI is created. What is this deployment model called?

A. In-place deployment
B. Blue/Green deployment
C. Immutable deployment
D. Canary deployment

Answer: C

Explanation: An immutable infrastructure deployment model involves creating a brand new, patched, and configured server image (AMI) for every new code release. Instead of updating existing servers, you replace them entirely with new servers launched from the new AMI. This leads to more consistent and reliable deployments.
---
Question #: 1096
A Network Load Balancer is listening on TCP port 443 and forwarding traffic to a target group of EC2 instances. The instances are also listening on TCP port 443. The target group health check is configured to use TCP on port 80. What is the likely result?

A. Traffic will flow correctly, and instances will be marked as healthy.
B. Traffic will flow correctly, but all instances will be marked as unhealthy because they are not listening on port 80.
C. Traffic will not flow because the listener and target ports must be different.
D. The load balancer configuration is invalid.

Answer: B

Explanation: The health check is independent of the traffic listener. The NLB will stop sending traffic to any instance that fails its health check. In this case, since the instances are listening on 443 but the health check is pinging port 80, the health check will fail. The NLB will mark all instances as unhealthy and will not forward any traffic to them, causing an outage.

Question #: 1097
What is the "split brain" problem in the context of high availability?

A. When an application's data becomes inconsistent across different servers.
B. When a system has two or more active master nodes because the nodes cannot communicate with each other and each believes it is the sole master.
C. When a load balancer sends traffic to an unhealthy instance.
D. When an Auto Scaling group scales out and scales in too rapidly.

Answer: B

Explanation: The split-brain problem can occur in high-availability clusters (like a database cluster). If the network connection between the nodes is lost, each node might think the other has failed. As a result, both nodes may try to assume the "master" role, leading to data corruption and inconsistency as both try to accept writes.
---
Question #: 1098
To achieve an extremely low Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO) for a global application, which architecture should be used?

A. An Auto Scaling group deployed across multiple Availability Zones in a single region.
B. An Amazon RDS database with Multi-AZ enabled.
C. A disaster recovery plan based on restoring EBS snapshots in another region.
D. A multi-region active-active architecture using services like Route 53 for routing and DynamoDB Global Tables or RDS Cross-Region Replicas for data replication.

Answer: D

Explanation: The lowest RTO (how fast you recover) and RPO (how much data you lose) are achieved with an active-active architecture. This involves having fully functional, independent deployments of your application in multiple AWS regions, with data being replicated between them in near real-time. Global services like Route 53 are then used to route users to the nearest or healthiest region, providing seamless failover.

Question #: 1099
A web application is deployed across multiple EC2 instances in a private subnet. These instances need to download software updates from the internet. What is the most cost-effective and scalable way to enable this outbound internet access without exposing the instances to inbound traffic?

A. Attach an Elastic IP address to each EC2 instance.
B. Place the instances in a public subnet.
C. Configure a NAT Gateway in a public subnet and route the private subnet's outbound traffic through it.
D. Configure a NAT instance in a public subnet, but do not disable the Source/Destination check.

Answer: C

Explanation: A NAT Gateway is a managed AWS service that provides highly available and scalable outbound internet access for instances in private subnets. It is the recommended approach over a self-managed NAT instance. Attaching an Elastic IP (A) or placing instances in a public subnet (B) would expose them to inbound internet traffic, which is insecure. A NAT instance requires the Source/Destination check to be disabled to function correctly (D).
---
Question #: 1100
What is the key difference between a Security Group and a Network ACL (NACL)?

A. Security Groups are stateless, while NACLs are stateful.
B. Security Groups operate at the instance level, while NACLs operate at the subnet level.
C. Security Groups can have both allow and deny rules, while NACLs can only have allow rules.
D. Security Groups process rules in numerical order, while NACLs process all rules before making a decision.

Answer: B

Explanation: The fundamental difference is their scope. A Security Group acts as a virtual firewall for an EC2 instance, controlling inbound and outbound traffic at the instance level. A Network ACL acts as a firewall for a subnet, controlling traffic in and out of one or more subnets. Security Groups are stateful (A), NACLs are stateless. NACLs have both allow and deny rules, while Security Groups only have allow rules (C). NACLs process rules in order (D), not all at once.
---
Question #: 1101
A Network ACL for a subnet has the following custom rules, in this order:
100: ALLOW TCP port 22 from 0.0.0.0/0
200: DENY TCP port 22 from 10.0.1.5/32
What is the effect of these rules on an SSH connection attempt from the IP address 10.0.1.5?

A. The connection will be allowed.
B. The connection will be denied.
C. The connection will be intermittently allowed and denied.
D. Both rules will be ignored, and the default rule will apply.

Answer: A

Explanation: Network ACLs evaluate rules in ascending order of their rule number. The first rule that matches the traffic is applied, and evaluation stops. In this case, the traffic (TCP port 22 from 10.0.1.5) matches rule 100 first, which is an ALLOW rule. Therefore, the connection is allowed, and rule 200 is never evaluated for this traffic.
---
Question #: 1102
An EC2 instance in a public subnet can be reached from the internet, but it cannot reach the internet itself for software updates. The instance has a public IP address. What is the most likely cause of this issue?

A. The associated Security Group does not have an outbound rule allowing traffic to the internet.
B. The subnet's route table does not have a route to the internet via an Internet Gateway.
C. The Network ACL is blocking outbound traffic.
D. The instance was not launched with an IAM role.

Answer: B

Explanation: For an instance in a public subnet to have internet access, its subnet's route table must contain a route (typically 0.0.0.0/0) that points to an Internet Gateway (IGW). While Security Groups (A) and NACLs (C) could also be the cause, the route table is the primary component for directing traffic out of the VPC to the internet. An IAM role (D) is for permissions, not network connectivity.
---
Question #: 1103
Which of the following statements about Security Groups are true? (Choose TWO)

A. They are stateful.
B. They operate at the subnet level.
C. They support both allow and deny rules.
D. All outbound traffic is allowed by default.
E. Rules are evaluated in numerical order.

Answer: A, D

Explanation: Security Groups are stateful (A), meaning if you allow an inbound request, the corresponding outbound response is automatically allowed, regardless of outbound rules. By default, a new Security Group allows all outbound traffic (D). They operate at the instance level (B), only support allow rules (C), and evaluate all rules at once, not in a specific order (E).
---
Question #: 1104
A company wants to establish a direct, private connection between their on-premises data center and their AWS VPC that bypasses the public internet. Which AWS service should they use?

A. VPC Peering
B. AWS Direct Connect
C. Internet Gateway
D. NAT Gateway

Answer: B

Explanation: AWS Direct Connect is a service that provides a dedicated, private network connection from your on-premises data center to AWS. This offers more consistent network performance and is more secure than an internet-based VPN connection. VPC Peering (A) connects two VPCs. Internet Gateway (C) and NAT Gateway (D) are for providing internet access.
---
Question #: 1105
What is the primary purpose of a Bastion Host (or Jump Box)?

A. To provide high-availability internet access to a private subnet.
B. To serve web traffic directly to the internet.
C. To provide a secure, publicly accessible server that you can connect to, which then acts as a proxy to access instances in a private subnet.
D. To store and manage SSH keys for all instances in a VPC.

Answer: C

Explanation: A Bastion Host is a security-hardened server placed in a public subnet. Administrators connect to the Bastion Host (e.g., via SSH or RDP), and from there, they can connect to the instances in the private subnets. This avoids exposing the private instances directly to the internet, significantly improving the security posture.
---
Question #: 1106
A VPC has been created with a CIDR block of 10.0.0.0/16. You need to create a subnet that can host up to 250 instances. What is the smallest subnet CIDR block you can use?

A. 10.0.1.0/25
B. 10.0.1.0/24
C. 10.0.1.0/23
D. 10.0.1.0/22

Answer: B

Explanation: A /24 CIDR block provides 256 total IP addresses (2^8). AWS reserves 5 of these addresses in each subnet (network address, VPC router, DNS, future use, and broadcast address), leaving 251 usable IP addresses. This is the smallest block that can accommodate 250 instances. A /25 block only provides 123 usable IPs, while /23 and /22 provide more than necessary.
---
Question #: 1107
Which feature allows you to privately access AWS services like S3 and DynamoDB from within your VPC without the traffic having to traverse the public internet?

A. NAT Gateway
B. Internet Gateway
C. VPC Peering
D. VPC Endpoint

Answer: D

Explanation: A VPC Endpoint enables private connections between your VPC and supported AWS services. There are two types: Gateway Endpoints (for S3 and DynamoDB) and Interface Endpoints (for most other services). They ensure that traffic to these services stays within the AWS network, which is more secure and can be faster.
---
Question #: 1108
By default, what is the state of a custom Network ACL when it is first created?

A. It allows all inbound and outbound traffic.
B. It denies all inbound and outbound traffic.
C. It allows all outbound traffic but denies all inbound traffic.
D. It is identical to the default Network ACL for the VPC.

Answer: B

Explanation: When you create a new, custom Network ACL, it starts with no rules. This means all inbound and outbound traffic is denied until you add explicit ALLOW rules. This is different from the VPC's default NACL, which starts by allowing all traffic.
---
Question #: 1109
An EC2 instance in a private subnet needs to make an API call to the Amazon SQS service. What is the most secure and efficient way to enable this connectivity?

A. Route the traffic through a NAT Gateway to the public SQS endpoint.
B. Create an Interface VPC Endpoint for SQS in the VPC.
C. Move the EC2 instance to a public subnet.
D. Use AWS Direct Connect to route the traffic to SQS.

Answer: B

Explanation: An Interface VPC Endpoint (powered by AWS PrivateLink) creates an elastic network interface (ENI) in your subnet with a private IP address. This ENI acts as the entry point for traffic destined for the service (in this case, SQS). This keeps all traffic within the AWS network, which is more secure and efficient than routing through a NAT Gateway (A).
---
Question #: 1110
A solutions architect has two VPCs, VPC-A and VPC-B, in the same AWS region. They need to enable instances in both VPCs to communicate with each other using private IP addresses as if they were on the same network. The VPCs have non-overlapping CIDR blocks. What should be configured?

A. A NAT Gateway
B. A VPC Peering connection
C. An Internet Gateway
D. AWS Direct Connect

Answer: B

Explanation: A VPC Peering connection is a networking connection between two VPCs that enables you to route traffic between them using private IPv4 or IPv6 addresses. It works between VPCs in the same account or different accounts, and in the same region or across regions. It's the standard solution for this use case.
---
Question #: 1111
Which of the following statements about NAT Gateways is FALSE?

A. A NAT Gateway must be placed in a public subnet.
B. A NAT Gateway must be associated with an Elastic IP address.
C. A NAT Gateway can be associated with a Security Group.
D. A NAT Gateway is a managed service with built-in redundancy within a single Availability Zone.

Answer: C

Explanation: Unlike a NAT Instance (which is just an EC2 instance), a NAT Gateway is a managed service that you cannot directly associate a Security Group with. Security for a NAT Gateway is controlled by the Network ACLs of the public subnet it resides in and the Security Groups of the instances in the private subnets that use it. All other statements are true.
---
Question #: 1112
You are designing a VPC and need to create a "public" subnet. What is the defining characteristic of a public subnet?

A. Its CIDR block is from the public IP address range.
B. Its associated route table has a route to an Internet Gateway.
C. It has a Network ACL that allows all traffic.
D. All instances within it have Elastic IP addresses.

Answer: B

Explanation: The term "public subnet" in AWS simply means that the subnet's route table has an entry that directs internet-bound traffic (0.0.0.0/0) to an Internet Gateway (IGW). This is what allows resources within it to be directly reachable from the internet (if they have a public IP).
---
Question #: 1113
What is the purpose of an Egress-Only Internet Gateway?

A. To allow outbound internet access for IPv4 traffic from a private subnet while denying inbound traffic.
B. To allow outbound internet access for IPv6 traffic from a private subnet while preventing the internet from initiating connections to the instances.
C. To filter outbound traffic based on a list of approved domain names.
D. To provide a private, dedicated connection to the internet.

Answer: B

Explanation: An Egress-Only Internet Gateway is specifically for IPv6. It is a stateful gateway that allows outbound-only communication over IPv6 from instances in your VPC to the internet, and prevents the internet from initiating an IPv6 connection with your instances. It serves a similar purpose for IPv6 as a NAT Gateway does for IPv4.
---
Question #: 1114
A Security Group has an inbound rule allowing TCP port 3389 (RDP) from the source IP 54.20.10.5/32. The Network ACL on the instance's subnet has an outbound rule denying traffic to port 3389. What is the result when the user at 54.20.10.5 tries to connect?

A. The connection is established successfully.
B. The initial connection request is allowed, but the response from the instance is blocked by the NACL.
C. The connection is blocked by the Security Group.
D. The connection is blocked by the Network ACL on ingress.

Answer: B

Explanation: Security Groups are stateful, and NACLs are stateless. The inbound RDP request is allowed by both the NACL (by default) and the Security Group. The EC2 instance sends a response. Because NACLs are stateless, the outbound response traffic must be evaluated by the outbound NACL rules. The NACL has a rule denying outbound port 3389, so the response packet is dropped, and the connection fails to establish.
---
Question #: 1115
You are troubleshooting a connectivity issue where an EC2 instance cannot be reached from your corporate office. You have verified that the Security Group allows traffic from your office's IP address. What should you check next?

A. The IAM role attached to the instance.
B. The Network ACL associated with the instance's subnet.
C. The instance's metadata service.
D. The VPC's default DHCP options set.

Answer: B

Explanation: When troubleshooting network connectivity, you must check all firewalls in the path. If the instance-level firewall (Security Group) is correctly configured, the next logical step is to check the subnet-level firewall (Network ACL) to ensure it is not blocking the inbound traffic.
---
Question #: 1116
Which component is responsible for directing network traffic between subnets within a VPC and to destinations outside the VPC (like the internet or a VPN)?

A. Security Group
B. Internet Gateway
C. Route Table
D. Network ACL

Answer: C

Explanation: A Route Table contains a set of rules, called routes, that are used to determine where network traffic from your subnet or gateway is directed. Every subnet in a VPC must be associated with a route table. This table is what controls the flow of traffic both within the VPC and to external destinations.
---
Question #: 1117
Which of the following is a key characteristic of a VPC Peering connection?

A. It is a transitive relationship; if VPC-A is peered with VPC-B, and VPC-B is peered with VPC-C, then VPC-A can communicate with VPC-C.
B. It uses a gateway device that can become a single point of failure.
C. It does not rely on the public internet; traffic uses the AWS private backbone network.
D. It encrypts all traffic by default using AWS KMS.

Answer: C

Explanation: Traffic over a VPC Peering connection always stays on the global AWS backbone and never traverses the public internet. This makes it secure and reliable. Peering is not transitive (A); you would need a separate peering connection between A and C. It does not use a gateway device in the traditional sense (B) and is not a single point of failure. Encryption in transit within a region is handled by the physical layer, but application-level encryption is a separate consideration (D).
---
Question #: 1118
You want to capture and log information about the IP traffic going to and from network interfaces in your VPC. Which service should you use?

A. AWS CloudTrail
B. Amazon CloudWatch Logs
C. VPC Flow Logs
D. AWS Trusted Advisor

Answer: C

Explanation: VPC Flow Logs is a feature that enables you to capture information about the IP traffic going to and from network interfaces in your VPC. This flow log data can be published to Amazon CloudWatch Logs or Amazon S3, and it is invaluable for troubleshooting network issues and for security analysis.
---
Question #: 1119
To make a Bastion Host secure, what is a recommended best practice for its Security Group configuration?

A. Allow SSH (port 22) access from any IP address (0.0.0.0/0).
B. Allow SSH (port 22) access only from a limited, specific set of IP addresses, such as your company's corporate network.
C. Attach the same Security Group to the Bastion Host and the private instances it manages.
D. Do not attach any Security Group to the Bastion Host.

Answer: B

Explanation: A key security principle for a Bastion Host is to tightly restrict access to it. The Security Group should be configured to allow inbound SSH/RDP traffic only from the trusted IP addresses of your administrators. Allowing access from 0.0.0.0/0 (A) would expose it to attacks from the entire internet. Using the same security group (C) for the bastion and private instances would violate the principle of least privilege.
---
Question #: 1120
You have a fleet of EC2 instances in a private subnet that process sensitive data. They do not need internet access, but they need to access a specific S3 bucket to retrieve data. How can you provide this access without allowing any other internet connectivity?

A. Create a NAT Gateway and use a Network ACL to deny all traffic except to S3.
B. Create a Gateway VPC Endpoint for S3 and add a route for it in the subnet's route table.
C. Configure an IAM role with S3 permissions and an Internet Gateway.
D. Use a Bastion Host to proxy the S3 traffic.

Answer: B

Explanation: A Gateway VPC Endpoint for S3 is the perfect solution. It creates a private connection to the S3 service. You add a prefix list for S3 to your route table, which directs S3-bound traffic to the endpoint instead of a NAT or Internet Gateway. This provides the required access without any traffic leaving the AWS network.
---
Question #: 1121
What is the maximum number of VPCs you can create per region in an AWS account by default?

A. 1
B. 5
C. 20
D. 100

Answer: B

Explanation: By default, AWS allows you to create up to 5 VPCs per region in your account. However, this is a soft limit, and you can request an increase by contacting AWS support.
---
Question #: 1122
In a default VPC, what networking components are created automatically? (Choose TWO)

A. A NAT Gateway
B. An Internet Gateway
C. A private subnet in each Availability Zone
D. A public subnet in each Availability Zone
E. A VPC Peering connection

Answer: B, D

Explanation: A default VPC is designed to be user-friendly and ready for use. It automatically includes an Internet Gateway (B) to provide internet access and a public subnet (D) in each Availability Zone in the region. It does not include a NAT Gateway (A), private subnets (C), or peering connections (E) by default.
---
Question #: 1123
When comparing a NAT Gateway and a NAT Instance, which of the following is an advantage of using a NAT Gateway?

A. It can be used as a Bastion Host.
B. It provides finer-grained control through Security Groups.
C. It is managed by AWS and offers higher availability and bandwidth.
D. It is cheaper for very low levels of traffic.

Answer: C

Explanation: The primary advantages of a NAT Gateway are that it is a fully managed service. AWS handles the administration, high availability (it's redundant within an AZ), and scaling of bandwidth (up to 45 Gbps). A NAT Instance (D) can be cheaper for very light workloads but requires you to manage patching, availability, and scaling. You cannot attach a security group to a NAT Gateway (B) or use it as a bastion host (A).
---
Question #: 1124
A Network ACL rule has the number *. What does this signify?

A. It is the first rule to be evaluated.
B. It is a custom rule created by a user.
C. It is the final, default rule that denies any traffic not explicitly allowed by a preceding rule.
D. It is a rule that applies to all protocols.

Answer: C

Explanation: The asterisk (*) represents the default rule at the end of every Network ACL's rule set. This rule cannot be modified or deleted. Its purpose is to ensure that any traffic that does not match one of the numbered (custom) rules is explicitly denied.
---
Question #: 1125
An instance in a private subnet needs to resolve a public DNS hostname (e.g., amazon.com). The VPC is configured with the default DNS resolver (`.2` address). The instance has no outbound internet path. Will the DNS resolution succeed?

A. Yes, the Amazon DNS resolver can be reached without internet access.
B. No, DNS resolution requires outbound internet access via a NAT Gateway.
C. No, DNS resolution can only be done from a public subnet.
D. Yes, but only if you configure a custom DNS server.

Answer: A

Explanation: The Amazon Route 53 Resolver (located at the reserved .2 address of your VPC CIDR) is reachable from within your VPC without requiring an Internet Gateway or NAT Gateway. An instance in a private subnet can successfully resolve public DNS hostnames. However, it will not be able to connect to the resolved public IP address without an outbound path like a NAT Gateway.
---
Question #: 1126
Which of the following is true about Security Group rules?

A. You can specify a source or destination by using another Security Group ID.
B. You must specify a CIDR block for all rules.
C. All rules must be explicitly numbered for evaluation order.
D. You can create rules that deny specific IP addresses.

Answer: A

Explanation: A powerful feature of Security Groups is the ability to reference another Security Group ID in a rule's source (for inbound) or destination (for outbound). This allows instances in one group to communicate with instances in another group without needing to know their specific IP addresses, which can change. Security groups only have allow rules (D).
---
Question #: 1127
You have a three-tier web application. The web servers are in a public subnet, and the application and database servers are in a private subnet. How should you configure Security Groups to allow the web servers to communicate with the application servers on port 8080?

A. Configure the application servers' Security Group to allow inbound traffic on port 8080 from the CIDR block of the public subnet.
B. Configure the application servers' Security Group to allow inbound traffic on port 8080 from the Security Group ID of the web servers.
C. Configure the application servers' Security Group to allow inbound traffic on port 8080 from 0.0.0.0/0.
D. Configure the web servers' Security Group to allow outbound traffic on port 8080 to the CIDR block of the private subnet.

Answer: B

Explanation: The best practice is to use Security Group references. By setting the source of the inbound rule on the application servers' Security Group to be the Security Group ID of the web servers, you create a dynamic and secure rule. This ensures that only instances in the web server group can communicate with the application servers on that port, regardless of their private IP addresses.
---
Question #: 1128
What happens if you associate a new route table with a subnet?

A. The subnet's existing route table is deleted.
B. The new route table's rules are merged with the existing route table's rules.
C. The subnet's previous route table is replaced with the new one.
D. This action is not possible; a subnet can only have one route table for its lifetime.

Answer: C

Explanation: A subnet can only be associated with one route table at a time. When you associate a different route table with a subnet, the previous association is removed, and the new route table immediately takes effect for all traffic routing from that subnet. The original route table is not deleted and may still be associated with other subnets.
---
Question #: 1129
What is the primary function of an Internet Gateway (IGW)?

A. To provide a target in your VPC route tables for internet-routable traffic.
B. To perform network address translation for instances in private subnets.
C. To filter traffic between subnets within a VPC.
D. To establish a private connection to another VPC.

Answer: A

Explanation: An Internet Gateway is a horizontally scaled, redundant, and highly available VPC component that allows communication between your VPC and the internet. Its main function is to serve as the target for the `0.0.0.0/0` route in the route tables of your public subnets.
---
Question #: 1130
A security audit requires that all traffic between your on-premises network and your VPC be encrypted. You are using an AWS Site-to-Site VPN connection. Is the traffic encrypted by default?

A. No, you must configure encryption separately using SSL/TLS.
B. Yes, all traffic over an AWS Site-to-Site VPN is encrypted using the IPsec protocol.
C. No, only the authentication headers are encrypted, not the data payload.
D. Yes, but only if you use an AWS Direct Connect connection in conjunction with the VPN.

Answer: B

Explanation: An AWS Site-to-Site VPN connection uses the Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) suite to secure the traffic. It establishes encrypted tunnels between your on-premises customer gateway and the AWS virtual private gateway, ensuring both authentication and encryption for all data in transit.
---
Question #: 1131
You are designing a VPC with subnets in two different Availability Zones for high availability. What is a key consideration for subnet CIDR blocks?

A. All subnets in a VPC must have the same CIDR block size.
B. Subnets in different AZs must have overlapping CIDR blocks.
C. Each subnet must have a CIDR block that is a subset of the VPC's CIDR block and does not overlap with other subnets.
D. You must use public IP address ranges for the subnet CIDR blocks.

Answer: C

Explanation: This is a fundamental rule of VPC subnetting. The CIDR block for every subnet you create must come from the overall CIDR block of the VPC. Furthermore, the CIDR blocks of any two subnets within the same VPC cannot overlap, as this would make routing ambiguous.
---
Question #: 1132
What does it mean when a Security Group is described as "stateful"?

A. It remembers the state of the EC2 instance (running, stopped).
B. It tracks the state of network connections. If an inbound request is allowed, the outbound response is automatically allowed.
C. It keeps a state table of all denied packets for auditing purposes.
D. Its rules can be changed dynamically without interrupting traffic.

Answer: B

Explanation: Stateful inspection means the firewall (in this case, the Security Group) maintains a record of active connections. When a packet is sent from an instance (outbound), the Security Group remembers this connection. When the reply comes back (inbound), it recognizes it as part of an existing, approved connection and allows it, regardless of the inbound rules. The reverse is also true for inbound-initiated connections.
---
Question #: 1133
An EC2 instance is hosting a database. The database should only accept connections from a specific set of application servers located in the same VPC. Which of the following is the MOST secure and flexible way to configure this?

A. In the database instance's Security Group, create an inbound rule allowing the database port from the CIDR range of the application server's subnet.
B. In the database instance's Security Group, create an inbound rule allowing the database port from the private IP addresses of each application server.
C. In the database instance's Security Group, create an inbound rule allowing the database port from the Security Group ID assigned to the application servers.
D. In the subnet's Network ACL, create an inbound rule allowing the database port from the Security Group ID of the application servers.

Answer: C

Explanation: Using Security Group IDs as a source is the most secure and flexible method. It ensures that only instances that are members of the specified application Security Group can connect, even if their IP addresses change or if you add or remove instances. Using CIDR ranges (A) is less specific, and using individual IPs (B) is difficult to manage. NACLs (D) cannot reference Security Group IDs.
---
Question #: 1134
You have an application running on EC2 instances behind an Application Load Balancer. You want to ensure that the EC2 instances only accept traffic from the load balancer. What should you do?

A. Configure the instances' Security Group to allow traffic on the application port from the Security Group of the Application Load Balancer.
B. Configure the instances' Security Group to allow traffic on the application port from the public IP address of the Application Load Balancer.
C. Configure the Network ACL of the instances' subnet to only allow traffic from the Application Load Balancer's Security Group.
D. Configure the Application Load Balancer to use a specific Elastic IP address and allow that in the instances' Security Group.

Answer: A

Explanation: This is the standard and best practice. You can configure the security group for your backend instances to allow traffic only from the security group attached to your Application Load Balancer. This creates a secure communication path and prevents users from bypassing the load balancer and accessing your instances directly.
---
Question #: 1135
Which of the following services can be used to privately connect your VPC to another VPC? (Choose TWO)

A. VPC Endpoint
B. VPC Peering
C. AWS Transit Gateway
D. NAT Gateway
E. Internet Gateway

Answer: B, C

Explanation: VPC Peering (B) is used to connect two VPCs directly. AWS Transit Gateway (C) acts as a central hub to connect multiple VPCs and on-premises networks together, simplifying network management at scale. A VPC Endpoint (A) connects a VPC to an AWS service. NAT (D) and Internet (E) gateways are for internet access.
---
Question #: 1136
What is the purpose of VPC Flow Logs?

A. To provide a real-time stream of all packets entering and leaving a VPC.
B. To capture metadata about the IP traffic for a network interface, subnet, or VPC.
C. To automatically block malicious IP addresses identified in the traffic.
D. To route traffic between different subnets.

Answer: B

Explanation: VPC Flow Logs capture metadata about the IP traffic, not the full packet content. This metadata includes information like the source and destination IP addresses, ports, protocol, packet counts, and whether the traffic was accepted or rejected by Security Groups and Network ACLs.
---
Question #: 1137
A web server in a public subnet needs to connect to a database server in a private subnet. The default Network ACL is being used for both subnets. What rules need to be configured in the Security Groups?

A. The web server's SG needs an outbound rule to the database. The database's SG needs an inbound rule from the web server.
B. Only the database server's SG needs an inbound rule from the web server.
C. Only the web server's SG needs an outbound rule to the database.
D. No rules are needed because the default Security Group allows all traffic.

Answer: A

Explanation: For communication to happen, the traffic must be explicitly allowed at both ends by the Security Groups. The originating group (web server SG) needs an outbound rule allowing traffic to the destination port and IP/SG. The destination group (database SG) needs an inbound rule allowing traffic from the source IP/SG on the destination port. The default SG does not allow any inbound traffic from other SGs.
---
Question #: 1138
Which of the following is an example of a valid CIDR block for a new VPC?

A. 10.0.0.0/8
B. 192.168.0.0/16
C. 172.16.0.0/12
D. All of the above.

Answer: D

Explanation: The allowed block sizes for a VPC range from /16 to /28. The IP ranges for private networks are defined in RFC 1918 as 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, and 192.168.0.0/16. You can create a VPC with a CIDR block that is a subset of these ranges, such as 10.0.0.0/16 or 192.168.0.0/24. All the options provided are valid ranges from which a VPC CIDR could be derived.

Question #: 1139
You are configuring a Network ACL to allow web traffic to your servers. You have created an inbound rule to ALLOW TCP port 80. What else must you do to ensure web traffic works correctly?

A. Nothing, NACLs are stateful.
B. Add an inbound rule to ALLOW TCP port 443.
C. Add an outbound rule to ALLOW TCP ephemeral ports (1024-65535).
D. Add an outbound rule to ALLOW TCP port 80.

Answer: C

Explanation: Network ACLs are stateless. This means you must explicitly allow both the request and the response traffic. An inbound web request comes in on port 80. The server's response goes out on an ephemeral port (in the range 1024-65535). Therefore, you need an outbound rule to allow traffic on these ephemeral ports for the response to be sent back to the client.

Question #: 1140
An organization needs to connect 15 VPCs in a hub-and-spoke model. Using VPC peering for this would be complex to manage. What AWS service simplifies this architecture?

A. AWS Direct Connect
B. VPC Endpoints
C. AWS Transit Gateway
D. AWS Global Accelerator

Answer: C

Explanation: AWS Transit Gateway is designed to solve this exact problem. It acts as a cloud router and a central hub. Each VPC connects to the Transit Gateway, and the Transit Gateway handles the routing between them. This avoids the complex "full mesh" of peering connections that would otherwise be required.
---
Question #: 1141
A solutions architect wants to use an AWS service to provide a single point of access control and DNS resolution for services hosted across multiple VPCs. The service should be accessible from an on-premises network. Which service fits this description?

A. Amazon Route 53
B. AWS PrivateLink
C. A NAT Gateway
D. An Interface VPC Endpoint

Answer: B

Explanation: AWS PrivateLink is the underlying technology for Interface VPC Endpoints. It allows you to expose a service in one VPC to other VPCs and on-premises networks securely and privately. The service is accessed through an ENI with a private IP in the consumer's VPC, and traffic never leaves the Amazon network.
---
Question #: 1142
When is it appropriate to use a NAT Instance instead of a NAT Gateway?

A. When you need the highest possible availability for outbound traffic.
B. When you need to support traffic volumes greater than 45 Gbps.
C. When you need to perform actions like port forwarding or intrusion prevention, which require a custom server configuration.
D. When you want to minimize administrative overhead.

Answer: C

Explanation: While a NAT Gateway is preferred in most cases, a NAT Instance (being a regular EC2 instance) provides more flexibility. If you have specific requirements like custom traffic filtering, logging, port forwarding, or running an IDS/IPS, a NAT Instance allows you to install and configure the necessary software.
---
Question #: 1143
What is the scope of a route table in an AWS VPC?

A. A route table is global for the entire VPC.
B. A route table is associated with a subnet.
C. A route table is associated with an EC2 instance.
D. A route table is associated with an Internet Gateway.

Answer: B

Explanation: Route tables control routing for subnets. Each subnet in your VPC must be associated with a route table. A route table can be associated with multiple subnets, but a subnet can only be associated with one route table at a time.
---
Question #: 1144
You have a set of EC2 instances in a private subnet that must be accessible for patching from a central management server located in another VPC. What is the most secure way to allow this access?

A. Create a VPC Peering connection and configure Security Groups to allow SSH from the management server's IP.
B. Assign an Elastic IP to each instance and allow SSH from the management server's Security Group.
C. Use an Internet Gateway and configure Network ACLs to allow SSH from the management server.
D. Create a public subnet and move the instances there.

Answer: A

Explanation: VPC Peering allows for private communication between the two VPCs. By combining this with a specific Security Group rule that allows SSH traffic only from the private IP address (or Security Group) of the management server, you establish a secure and private path for patching without any exposure to the public internet.
---
Question #: 1145
When a VPC is created, it automatically gets a main route table. What is the initial state of this main route table?

A. It contains a route to an Internet Gateway.
B. It contains a route to a NAT Gateway.
C. It contains only a local route, allowing communication within the VPC.
D. It is empty and must be configured manually.

Answer: C

Explanation: The main route table created with a VPC contains only one rule by default: the "local" route. This route allows all resources within the VPC to communicate with each other over their private IP addresses. It does not contain routes to any gateways initially.
---
Question #: 1146
How does a Gateway VPC Endpoint for S3 appear in your VPC?

A. As an Elastic Network Interface (ENI) in one of your subnets.
B. As a new target type in your route tables.
C. As a virtual gateway device attached to your VPC.
D. As a new DNS hostname that resolves to a private IP.

Answer: B

Explanation: A Gateway Endpoint does not use an ENI. Instead, you create the endpoint and then modify your route table(s). You add a route where the destination is a prefix list for the S3 service, and the target is the VPC endpoint's ID (e.g., vpce-xxxxxxxx).
---
Question #: 1147
Which of the following would prevent you from deleting a VPC?

A. The VPC still contains a default Security Group.
B. The VPC still contains running EC2 instances or other dependent resources.
C. The VPC is peered with another VPC.
D. The VPC has a custom Network ACL.

Answer: B

Explanation: Before you can delete a VPC, you must terminate or delete all the resources within it. This includes EC2 instances, NAT gateways, VPC endpoints, load balancers, and network interfaces. You cannot delete a VPC that still has active resources inside it.
---
Question #: 1148
Which of the following statements about Network ACLs is TRUE?

A. They are stateful, so return traffic is automatically allowed.
B. They can filter traffic based on EC2 instance tags.
C. They evaluate rules based on their rule number, from lowest to highest.
D. They can be associated directly with an EC2 instance.

Answer: C

Explanation: NACLs are stateless firewalls that process rules in order. When a packet arrives at the subnet boundary, the NACL checks its rules in ascending numerical order (e.g., 100, then 200, then 300). The first rule that matches the packet's protocol, port, and source/destination IP is applied, and the evaluation stops.
---
Question #: 1149
You have an EC2 instance in a private subnet that hosts a backend service. This service needs to connect to the internet to call a third-party API. The VPC has a NAT Gateway. What needs to be configured in the private subnet's route table?

A. A route with destination 0.0.0.0/0 pointing to the Internet Gateway.
B. A route with destination 0.0.0.0/0 pointing to the NAT Gateway.
C. A route with the third-party API's IP address pointing to the NAT Gateway.
D. A route with destination 0.0.0.0/0 pointing to the instance's Elastic Network Interface.

Answer: B

Explanation: To provide outbound internet access for a private subnet, its route table must have a default route (destination 0.0.0.0/0) that directs all internet-bound traffic to the NAT Gateway. The NAT Gateway, residing in a public subnet, then forwards the traffic to the Internet Gateway.
---
Question #: 1150
What is the primary benefit of using multiple Availability Zones for your subnets?

A. It reduces network latency between instances.
B. It increases the number of IP addresses available in the VPC.
C. It allows you to create a high-availability architecture that can withstand an AZ failure.
D. It simplifies the routing configuration within the VPC.

Answer: C

Explanation: Deploying your application across subnets in multiple Availability Zones is a fundamental AWS best practice for building resilient and highly available systems. If one AZ experiences an outage, your application resources in the other AZs can continue to operate.
---
Question #: 1151
When configuring a security group rule, which of the following can be used as a source or destination? (Choose TWO)

A. A MAC address
B. A CIDR block
C. Another Security Group ID
D. A Subnet ID
E. A VPC ID

Answer: B, C

Explanation: Security group rules control traffic based on IP protocols and ports. The source (for inbound rules) or destination (for outbound rules) can be specified as either a CIDR block (e.g., 10.0.0.0/24 or 54.1.2.3/32) or the ID of another security group.
---
Question #: 1152
What is the difference between an Internet Gateway and a NAT Gateway?

A. An Internet Gateway allows inbound and outbound traffic, while a NAT Gateway allows only outbound traffic.
B. An Internet Gateway is for IPv4, and a NAT Gateway is for IPv6.
C. An Internet Gateway performs Network Address Translation, while a NAT Gateway does not.
D. An Internet Gateway must be placed in a private subnet.

Answer: A

Explanation: The core difference is the direction of traffic initiation. An Internet Gateway (IGW) enables two-way communication, allowing resources with public IPs to be reached from the internet (inbound) and to reach the internet (outbound). A NAT Gateway enables one-way communication, allowing resources in a private subnet to initiate connections to the internet (outbound), but preventing the internet from initiating connections to them.
---
Question #: 1153
You are setting up a Bastion Host. Its Security Group allows inbound SSH from your office IP. The private instances it needs to manage have a Security Group that allows inbound SSH from the Bastion Host's Security Group. The private instances still cannot be reached from the Bastion. What is a possible reason?

A. The Bastion Host does not have an outbound rule in its Security Group allowing SSH traffic to the private instances.
B. The Bastion Host is in a different Availability Zone than the private instances.
C. The VPC route table does not have a "local" route.
D. The Network ACL is blocking the traffic.

Answer: D

Explanation: Since Security Groups are stateful, the default outbound allow-all rule would normally handle the connection from the Bastion. If that is in place, the next firewall to check is the Network ACL. The NACL for either the public subnet (outbound) or the private subnet (inbound) could be blocking the SSH traffic. While (A) is possible if the default outbound rule was changed, the NACL is a very common point of failure in this scenario.
---
Question #: 1154
Which AWS networking construct provides a way to logically isolate a section of the AWS Cloud?

A. Subnet
B. Availability Zone
C. Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
D. Security Group

Answer: C

Explanation: An Amazon VPC is a virtual network dedicated to your AWS account. It is logically isolated from other virtual networks in the AWS Cloud. This allows you to launch AWS resources into a network environment that you control, including IP address range selection, subnet creation, and configuration of route tables and network gateways.
---
Question #: 1155
A VPC has two subnets. Subnet A has a route to an Internet Gateway. Subnet B has a route to a NAT Gateway. Which subnet is considered "public"?

A. Subnet A
B. Subnet B
C. Both are public
D. Neither are public

Answer: A

Explanation: A subnet is defined as "public" if its traffic is routed directly to an Internet Gateway. This allows resources within it (with public IPs) to be directly addressable from the internet. A subnet that routes its outbound traffic through a NAT Gateway is, by definition, a "private" subnet.
---
Question #: 1156
You have created a custom VPC and launched an EC2 instance into a public subnet. You have assigned a public IP address to the instance, but you cannot connect to it from the internet. You have verified the route table has a route to the IGW. What is the most likely reason?

A. The associated Network ACL is blocking inbound traffic.
B. The associated Security Group does not have an inbound rule allowing your traffic.
C. The instance does not have an IAM role.
D. VPC Flow Logs are disabled.

Answer: B

Explanation: A very common reason for connectivity failure is the Security Group configuration. By default, Security Groups do not allow any inbound traffic. You must explicitly add an inbound rule that allows traffic (e.g., SSH on port 22 or HTTP on port 80) from your source IP address or 0.0.0.0/0.
---
Question #: 1157
What is the purpose of AWS PrivateLink?

A. To create a secure, encrypted tunnel between your on-premises data center and AWS.
B. To provide secure and private connectivity between VPCs, AWS services, and on-premises applications.
C. To accelerate the delivery of content over the public internet.
D. To automatically assign private IP addresses to EC2 instances.

Answer: B

Explanation: AWS PrivateLink is the technology that powers Interface VPC Endpoints and Endpoint Services. It provides a way to access services privately from your VPC without using public IPs, NAT gateways, or internet gateways. This keeps all traffic on the Amazon network, enhancing security and simplifying network architecture.
---
Question #: 1158
You have set up VPC peering between VPC-A and VPC-B. An instance in VPC-A needs to communicate with an instance in VPC-B. What must be updated to enable this communication?

A. Only the Security Groups in both VPCs.
B. The route tables in both VPCs.
C. The Network ACLs in both VPCs.
D. Both the route tables and the Security Groups in both VPCs.

Answer: D

Explanation: Establishing a VPC peering connection is a two-step process after the connection is created and accepted. First, you must update the route tables in each VPC to direct traffic destined for the other VPC's CIDR block to the peering connection. Second, you must ensure that the Security Groups (and potentially Network ACLs) in each VPC allow the traffic to flow from the peered VPC's CIDR block or security groups.
---
Question #: 1159
Which CIDR block is reserved by AWS within a subnet?

A. The first IP address (e.g., 10.0.1.0)
B. The last IP address (e.g., 10.0.1.255)
C. The second IP address (e.g., 10.0.1.1)
D. All of the above are part of the 5 reserved addresses.

Answer: D

Explanation: In every subnet, AWS reserves the first four IP addresses and the last IP address. For a `10.0.1.0/24` subnet, these are: `10.0.1.0` (Network address), `10.0.1.1` (VPC router), `10.0.1.2` (DNS resolver), `10.0.1.3` (Reserved for future use), and `10.0.1.255` (Network broadcast address).
---
Question #: 1160
You need to provide internet access to a fleet of EC2 instances for patching, but these instances should not have public IP addresses. This solution needs to be highly available and scale automatically. What should you use?

A. A single, large NAT instance.
B. Multiple NAT instances behind an Auto Scaling Group and a Network Load Balancer.
C. A NAT Gateway.
D. An Egress-Only Internet Gateway.

Answer: C

Explanation: A NAT Gateway is the ideal solution for this requirement. It is an AWS-managed service that is inherently highly available within its deployed Availability Zone and automatically scales to meet bandwidth needs. It provides the required outbound-only internet access without requiring you to manage the underlying infrastructure.
---
Question #: 1161
A company has a VPC connected to their on-premises network via an AWS Direct Connect. They now want to access an S3 bucket from their on-premises servers over this private connection. What do they need to configure?

A. A public virtual interface (VIF) on their Direct Connect connection.
B. A NAT Gateway in the VPC.
C. A Gateway VPC Endpoint for S3 in the VPC.
D. A transit virtual interface (VIF) and a Transit Gateway.

Answer: A

Explanation: To access public AWS services like S3 over a Direct Connect connection, you need to configure a public virtual interface (VIF). This allows your on-premises network to access the public IP endpoints of AWS services, with the traffic routing over your private Direct Connect link instead of the public internet.
---
Question #: 1162
What is the effective permission if a Security Group allows a connection, but a Network ACL denies it?

A. The connection is allowed.
B. The connection is denied.
C. The connection is throttled.
D. An alert is sent to the account administrator.

Answer: B

Explanation: For traffic to reach an instance, it must be allowed by both the Network ACL (at the subnet level) and the Security Group (at the instance level). If either one denies the traffic, the connection will fail. The NACL is checked first for inbound traffic, so it would be denied at the subnet boundary.
---
Question #: 1163
Your application in a private subnet needs to send logs to Amazon CloudWatch Logs. The VPC has no NAT Gateway or Internet Gateway. How can you enable this?

A. This is not possible without a NAT Gateway.
B. Create an Interface VPC Endpoint for CloudWatch Logs.
C. Install the CloudWatch agent using an S3 bucket and a Gateway Endpoint.
D. Create a public subnet and move the application.

Answer: B

Explanation: You can use an Interface VPC Endpoint for CloudWatch Logs. This creates an ENI with a private IP in your subnet, allowing your application to send logs to the CloudWatch Logs service endpoint without the traffic ever leaving the AWS network. This is the most secure and recommended method.
---
Question #: 1164
What happens if a subnet is not explicitly associated with a route table?

A. Instances in that subnet cannot route traffic.
B. It is automatically associated with the VPC's main route table.
C. The subnet cannot be used to launch resources.
D. It is automatically associated with a new, empty route table.

Answer: B

Explanation: If you do not explicitly associate a subnet with a specific route table, AWS automatically associates it with the main route table of the VPC. This makes the main route table the default for any new subnets.
---
Question #: 1165
You are creating a VPC to host a publicly accessible website. What is the minimum number of subnets you should create to ensure high availability?

A. One public subnet.
B. One public subnet and one private subnet.
C. Two public subnets in the same Availability Zone.
D. Two public subnets in different Availability Zones.

Answer: D

Explanation: For high availability, you should always design your architecture to be resilient to the failure of a single Availability Zone. Therefore, the minimum recommended setup is to have at least two subnets, each located in a different AZ. For a public website, these would be public subnets.
---
Question #: 1166
Which component is stateful and evaluates all rules before making a decision on a packet?

A. Network ACL
B. Route Table
C. Security Group
D. Internet Gateway

Answer: C

Explanation: A Security Group is stateful. It evaluates all the rules in its list simultaneously to decide whether to allow a packet. This is different from a Network ACL, which evaluates rules in a specific numerical order.
---
Question #: 1167
A VPC Peering connection has been established between VPC-A and VPC-B. Both are in the same account and region. What does this connection status of "active" signify?

A. Instances can now communicate between the VPCs.
B. The connection is ready, but route tables must be updated to enable traffic flow.
C. The connection is pending acceptance from the owner of VPC-B.
D. DNS resolution between the VPCs is now enabled.

Answer: B

Explanation: An "active" status on a VPC peering connection means that the logical link has been established. However, no traffic will flow until you update the route tables in each VPC to tell them where to send traffic destined for the other VPC's CIDR block.
---
Question #: 1168
You have configured VPC Flow Logs to publish to CloudWatch Logs. What information is NOT included in a flow log record?

A. The source and destination IP addresses.
B. The protocol and port numbers.
C. The packet's data payload or content.
D. The action (ACCEPT or REJECT).

Answer: C

Explanation: VPC Flow Logs are designed to capture metadata about traffic, not the actual content of the traffic itself. This is for security and performance reasons. It provides information about the traffic flow but does not perform deep packet inspection.
---
Question #: 1169
What is the purpose of disabling the "Source/Destination Check" attribute on an EC2 instance?

A. To allow the instance to function as a Bastion Host.
B. To allow the instance to forward traffic that is not addressed to its own IP address, such as when acting as a NAT instance.
C. To improve the network performance of the instance.
D. To assign multiple private IP addresses to the instance.

Answer: B

Explanation: By default, an EC2 instance checks whether it is the source or destination of any traffic it sends or receives. For an instance to function as a network appliance like a NAT instance, a router, or a firewall, it needs to be able to handle traffic on behalf of other instances. Disabling the source/destination check allows it to do this.
---
Question #: 1170
An organization has a requirement that all EC2 instances must be launched into a private subnet and are not allowed to have public IP addresses. How can this be enforced?

A. By using an IAM policy to deny the `ec2:AssociateAddress` action.
B. By creating only private subnets and disabling the "auto-assign public IP" setting on them.
C. By using a Service Control Policy (SCP) to deny the `ec2:RunInstances` action if a public IP is requested.
D. All of the above are valid methods.

Answer: D

Explanation: You can use multiple layers of controls to enforce this policy. You can configure your subnets to not auto-assign public IPs (B), which is a good first step. You can also use IAM policies (A) or SCPs (C) to create a preventative guardrail that explicitly denies the actions that would associate a public IP, providing a more robust enforcement mechanism.
---
Question #: 1171
What is a primary use case for AWS Transit Gateway?

A. To connect a single VPC to the internet.
B. To connect thousands of VPCs and on-premises networks within a simplified hub-and-spoke architecture.
C. To provide low-latency access to AWS services like S3.
D. To create a peer-to-peer connection between two VPCs.

Answer: B

Explanation: Transit Gateway is designed to simplify networking at scale. Instead of creating a complex mesh of VPC peering connections, each network (VPC or on-premises via VPN/Direct Connect) connects to the central Transit Gateway, which handles all the routing.
---
Question #: 1172
A security group inbound rule allows traffic from `sg-12345abc`. What does this mean?

A. It allows traffic from any instance that has the tag `Name=sg-12345abc`.
B. It allows traffic from the subnet where the security group `sg-12345abc` is located.
C. It allows traffic from any network interface that is associated with the security group `sg-12345abc`.
D. It allows traffic from the public IP address `123.45.abc`.

Answer: C

Explanation: When you reference a security group ID as the source in a rule, you are allowing traffic from all the elastic network interfaces (and therefore, all the instances) that are associated with that source security group.
---
Question #: 1173
Which component is stateless and evaluates rules in numerical order?

A. Security Group
B. NAT Gateway
C. Network ACL
D. Route 53 Resolver

Answer: C

Explanation: A Network ACL is a stateless firewall. It processes its inbound and outbound rules separately, in ascending order of the rule number. The first rule that matches the traffic is immediately applied.
---
Question #: 1174
You have a fleet of instances in a private subnet. How can you ensure they all use the same public IP address for outbound internet communication?

A. This is not possible; each instance will get a random IP from a pool.
B. Configure a NAT Gateway with an Elastic IP address and route the subnet's traffic through it.
C. Configure an Internet Gateway with a specific Elastic IP address.
D. Assign the same Elastic IP address to all the instances.

Answer: B

Explanation: A NAT Gateway is associated with a single, static Elastic IP address. When instances in a private subnet send traffic through the NAT Gateway, all the traffic will appear to originate from that single Elastic IP. This is useful when you need to whitelist your application's IP address with a third party.
---
Question #: 1175
You need to create a subnet that can contain exactly 60 usable IP addresses for EC2 instances. Which CIDR block should you use?

A. /27 (32 IPs, 27 usable)
B. /26 (64 IPs, 59 usable)
C. /25 (128 IPs, 123 usable)
D. /26 (64 IPs, 62 usable)

Answer: B

Explanation: A /26 CIDR block provides 2^(32-26) = 2^6 = 64 IP addresses. After subtracting the 5 reserved addresses, you are left with 59 usable IPs. This does not meet the requirement. Let's recheck. A /26 has 64-5=59 usable IPs. A /25 has 128-5=123 usable IPs. There seems to be a slight miscalculation in the options. However, let's re-evaluate the question. "exactly 60 usable IP addresses". None of the standard CIDR blocks provide exactly 60. The closest without going under is /25. But that's not "exactly". The closest is /26 with 59. This might be a trick question or a flawed question. Let's assume the question meant "at least 60". In that case, /25 would be the answer. If the question is strict, none are correct. Let's assume there's a typo in the option. Let's assume the question meant to find the closest fit.
*Correction:* Let's re-read the options and question. A /26 gives 64 total addresses. AWS reserves 5. This leaves 59 usable addresses. This is the closest to 60 without going significantly over. There might be a typo in the question or options. Given standard AWS questions, they are usually precise. Let's assume the question is valid and re-evaluate. The question is likely asking for the block that *can contain* 60 instances, implying "at least 60". A /26 provides 59, which is not enough. A /25 provides 123, which is enough. Therefore /25 is the smallest block that satisfies the condition.

Answer: C

Explanation: A /26 CIDR block provides 64 IP addresses, but after AWS reserves 5, only 59 are usable, which is not enough. A /25 CIDR block provides 128 IP addresses, and after reserving 5, 123 are usable. This is the smallest standard CIDR block that can accommodate at least 60 instances.

Question #: 1176
An EC2 instance needs to be accessible via SSH. Which of the following configurations is required?

A. An inbound Security Group rule allowing TCP port 22 and an outbound NACL rule allowing the ephemeral port range.
B. An inbound Security Group rule allowing UDP port 22.
C. An inbound Network ACL rule allowing TCP port 22 and an outbound Security Group rule allowing all traffic.
D. An inbound Security Group rule allowing TCP port 22 and a route table entry to an Internet Gateway.

Answer: D

Explanation: For an instance to be accessible from the internet, a few things are needed. It needs a public IP, the subnet's route table must point to an Internet Gateway (D), and its Security Group must allow the inbound traffic (e.g., TCP port 22 for SSH). Option A is also partially correct as the NACL needs to allow traffic, but the route table is a more fundamental requirement for internet reachability.
---
Question #: 1177
Which of the following is true regarding the default security group for a VPC?

A. It denies all inbound traffic and allows all outbound traffic by default.
B. It allows all inbound traffic from instances within the same security group and allows all outbound traffic.
C. It denies all inbound and all outbound traffic by default.
D. It allows all inbound and all outbound traffic by default.

Answer: B

Explanation: The default security group is configured to be more permissive for internal communication. Its initial state includes a rule that allows all inbound traffic from other network interfaces assigned to the same security group. It also includes the standard rule allowing all outbound traffic. It does NOT allow any other inbound traffic by default.
---
Question #: 1178
You want to enable DNS resolution for your VPC peering connection so you can resolve public DNS hostnames to private IP addresses across VPCs. What must you do?

A. Enable the "DNS resolution" option on the VPC settings.
B. Enable the "DNS hostnames" option on the VPC settings.
C. Enable the VPC peering connection setting for "DNS resolution".
D. Manually configure a Route 53 private hosted zone.

Answer: C

Explanation: Even if DNS resolution is enabled for the VPCs themselves, you must explicitly enable it for the peering connection. There is a specific option in the VPC peering connection settings for both the requester and the accepter VPC that must be enabled to allow this cross-VPC DNS resolution.
---
Question #: 1179
A company has a Direct Connect connection to their VPC. They want to create a backup connection that will be used only if the Direct Connect fails. What is the standard AWS solution for this?

A. A second Direct Connect connection.
B. A VPC Peering connection.
C. An AWS Site-to-Site VPN connection configured as a backup.
D. A NAT Gateway.

Answer: C

Explanation: A common high-availability pattern is to use a primary AWS Direct Connect connection and configure a lower-cost AWS Site-to-Site VPN connection as a failover backup. You can configure routing (e.g., using BGP) to prefer the Direct Connect link and automatically fail over to the VPN if the primary link goes down.
---
Question #: 1180
Can a security group be associated with multiple EC2 instances?

A. Yes, a security group can be associated with any number of instances.
B. No, a security group has a one-to-one relationship with an instance.
C. Yes, but only if the instances are in the same subnet.
D. Yes, but only if the instances are in the same Availability Zone.

Answer: A

Explanation: Security groups are designed to be reusable. A single security group can be applied to many EC2 instances, allowing you to apply a consistent set of firewall rules to a group of instances that have the same function (e.g., all your web servers).
---
Question #: 1181
What is the largest CIDR block size that can be assigned to a VPC?

A. /8
B. /12
C. /16
D. /24

Answer: C

Explanation: When you create a VPC, you must specify a CIDR block for the VPC. The allowed block size is between /16 netmask (65,536 IP addresses) and /28 netmask (16 IP addresses).
---
Question #: 1182
A company has deployed an application in a VPC. They need to inspect all traffic going to and from the internet for malicious activity. What solution would allow for this?

A. Configure VPC Flow Logs to send data to an IDS/IPS system.
B. Deploy a fleet of EC2 instances with IDS/IPS software and route all traffic through them using a Gateway Load Balancer.
C. Use Network ACLs to block known malicious IP ranges.
D. Use AWS Shield Advanced.

Answer: B

Explanation: To perform deep packet inspection for intrusion detection/prevention (IDS/IPS), you need to route traffic through a network appliance. The modern AWS architecture for this uses a Gateway Load Balancer, which acts as a transparent bump-in-the-wire to send traffic to a fleet of security appliances (running on EC2) for inspection before forwarding it to its destination.

Question #: 1183
Which of these is NOT a component of an AWS Site-to-Site VPN connection?

A. Virtual Private Gateway
B. Customer Gateway
C. NAT Gateway
D. IPsec Tunnel

Answer: C

Explanation: An AWS Site-to-Site VPN connects your on-premises network to your VPC. It consists of a Virtual Private Gateway on the AWS side, a Customer Gateway device or software on your side, and two encrypted IPsec Tunnels that connect them. A NAT Gateway is used for providing outbound internet access from a VPC, not for a VPN connection.

Question #: 1184
You have a public subnet and a private subnet. You want to move an EC2 instance from the public subnet to the private subnet. What is the easiest way to do this?

A. Create an AMI of the instance and launch a new instance from the AMI into the private subnet.
B. Change the subnet association of the running instance in the EC2 console.
C. Stop the instance, detach its network interface, and re-attach it to the private subnet.
D. This is not possible; you must terminate the instance and launch a new one.

Answer: A

Explanation: You cannot directly move a running EC2 instance from one subnet to another. The standard and easiest procedure is to create an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) from the original instance. Then, you launch a new instance from that AMI, making sure to select the desired private subnet during the launch process.

Question #: 1185
What is the main purpose of the `local` route that exists in every route table?

A. To route traffic to the local machine's loopback address.
B. To enable communication between all instances within the VPC.
C. To allow instances to communicate with the EC2 metadata service.
D. To direct traffic destined for the public internet.

Answer: B

Explanation: The `local` route is automatically added to all route tables in a VPC. Its destination is the VPC's CIDR block, and its target is `local`. This rule allows all resources within the VPC to freely communicate with each other using their private IP addresses. It cannot be modified or deleted.

Question #: 1186
What is a key security benefit of using a VPC?

A. All traffic within a VPC is automatically encrypted.
B. It provides logical isolation for your AWS resources from other customers.
C. It automatically applies patches to all EC2 instances.
D. It prevents any resource from accessing the internet by default.

Answer: B

Explanation: A VPC provides a logically isolated portion of the AWS Cloud where you can launch resources in a virtual network that you define. This isolation is a fundamental security benefit, as your resources are not accessible by other AWS customers unless you explicitly allow it.
---
Question #: 1187
You need to add a secondary CIDR block to your existing VPC. What is a key restriction for this secondary CIDR block?

A. It must be larger than the primary CIDR block.
B. It must not overlap with the primary CIDR block or any other existing secondary CIDR blocks.
C. It must be from the same RFC 1918 private address range as the primary block.
D. It can only be added if the VPC is empty.

Answer: B

Explanation: When you add a secondary CIDR block to a VPC, it must not overlap with any of the existing CIDR blocks (primary or secondary) associated with that VPC. It also cannot overlap with the CIDR block of any peered VPC or any network connected via VPN or Direct Connect.

Question #: 1188
If you want to use your own corporate DNS servers for instances within your VPC, what should you configure?

A. The VPC's main route table.
B. A custom DHCP options set.
C. The security group for each instance.
D. A VPC Endpoint for Route 53.

Answer: B

Explanation: A DHCP options set is a group of network configurations that you can associate with your VPC. You can create a custom set to specify your own domain name servers, domain name, NTP servers, and NetBIOS node type. This custom set can then be associated with the VPC to override the defaults.
---
Question #: 1189
An instance in a public subnet has a security group that allows inbound HTTP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0. The subnet's NACL has an inbound rule denying all traffic from 0.0.0.0/0. What is the result?

A. HTTP traffic is allowed.
B. HTTP traffic is denied.
C. Only HTTPS traffic is allowed.
D. Traffic is allowed, but responses are blocked.

Answer: B

Explanation: The Network ACL is evaluated before the Security Group for inbound traffic. Since the NACL has a rule that explicitly denies all traffic, the HTTP request will be blocked at the subnet boundary and will never reach the instance or its security group.

Question #: 1190
You have a fleet of EC2 instances for batch processing in a private subnet. They need to pull jobs from an SQS queue. The data is not sensitive, and performance is the top priority. What is the most cost-effective way to provide this connectivity?

A. Deploy a NAT Gateway.
B. Deploy an Interface VPC Endpoint for SQS.
C. Deploy a NAT Instance.
D. Assign public IPs and use an Internet Gateway.

Answer: A

Explanation: While a VPC Endpoint (B) is the most secure, a NAT Gateway (A) is also a perfectly valid and often cost-effective solution for general outbound access to AWS services, especially if the instances also need to access other internet resources. For purely SQS access, the endpoint is better, but NAT is a common general-purpose solution. Given the options, let's reconsider. The endpoint keeps traffic private. If cost is the main driver and performance matters, the endpoint avoids NAT gateway processing charges.
*Correction:* Data transfer pricing for Interface Endpoints can be more expensive than NAT Gateway pricing for high-volume cross-AZ traffic. However, for accessing AWS services, the endpoint is generally more performant as it avoids the NAT layer and stays on the AWS backbone. Let's assume a typical scenario.

Answer: B

Explanation: An Interface VPC Endpoint for SQS is the most performant and secure solution. It provides a private IP address within your VPC for the SQS service, keeping all traffic on the highly optimized AWS network and avoiding the need for a NAT device or public internet traversal. While a NAT Gateway works, the endpoint is a more direct and often faster path for this specific use case.

Question #: 1191
What is the purpose of AWS Shield Standard?

A. It is a managed Web Application Firewall (WAF).
B. It provides protection against common, most frequently occurring network and transport layer DDoS attacks for all AWS customers automatically and at no additional charge.
C. It provides advanced, 24/7 managed protection against large and sophisticated DDoS attacks.
D. It is a tool for scanning your VPC for security vulnerabilities.

Answer: B

Explanation: AWS Shield Standard is automatically enabled for all AWS customers. It provides always-on detection and automatic inline mitigations against the most common network and transport layer DDoS attacks that target your AWS resources. AWS Shield Advanced (C) is a paid service with more comprehensive protections.

Question #: 1192
An EC2 instance has two network interfaces (ENIs), and each ENI is associated with a different security group. How are the security group rules applied?

A. The rules from both security groups are merged, and the most permissive rule is applied.
B. The rules from both security groups are evaluated, and only rules present in both are applied.
C. The rules of each security group are applied only to the traffic passing through its associated ENI.
D. Only the rules of the security group attached to the primary network interface (eth0) are applied.

Answer: C

Explanation: Security groups are applied at the network interface level. Each ENI can have its own set of security groups. The rules of a given security group are enforced only for the traffic that flows through the specific ENI it is associated with.

Question #: 1193
You need to connect 50 retail stores to your VPC. Each store has a low-bandwidth, intermittent connection requirement. What is the most cost-effective and scalable AWS solution?

A. An AWS Direct Connect for each store.
B. A VPC Peering connection for each store.
C. An AWS Site-to-Site VPN connection for each store.
D. An AWS Transit Gateway with a single VPN connection from each store.

Answer: D

Explanation: While you could set up 50 individual Site-to-Site VPNs (C), this becomes complex to manage. A more scalable solution is to use AWS Transit Gateway. Each store establishes a VPN connection to the Transit Gateway, which then acts as a central point for routing traffic into the VPC. This simplifies the architecture and management significantly.
---
Question #: 1194
Can you associate a security group with an EC2 instance in a different VPC?

A. Yes, if the VPCs are peered.
B. Yes, if the VPCs are in the same region.
C. No, a security group is specific to a VPC and can only be associated with resources in that same VPC.
D. Yes, by referencing the security group's ARN.

Answer: C

Explanation: Security groups are a VPC-specific resource. A security group created in VPC-A cannot be directly attached to an instance in VPC-B. While you can reference a security group from a peered VPC in a rule, you cannot associate it directly with a resource in another VPC.

Question #: 1195
What is the "Five-Tuple" that VPC Flow Logs capture?

A. Source IP, Destination IP, Protocol, Packet Size, and Action (Accept/Reject).
B. Source IP, Destination IP, Source Port, Destination Port, and Protocol.
C. VPC ID, Subnet ID, Instance ID, Protocol, and Action (Accept/Reject).
D. Source MAC, Destination MAC, Source IP, Destination IP, and Protocol.

Answer: B

Explanation: A five-tuple is a standard networking term used to uniquely identify a connection. It consists of the Source IP address, Source Port, Destination IP address, Destination Port, and the Protocol (e.g., TCP, UDP, ICMP). VPC Flow Logs capture this information for each flow.
---
Question #: 1196
What is the default limit for the number of security groups you can associate with a single EC2 instance?

A. 1
B. 5
C. 10
D. 50

Answer: B

Explanation: By default, you can associate up to 5 security groups with a single network interface, and therefore with a single EC2 instance (that has one ENI). This limit can be increased by request.
---
Question #: 1197
A VPC spans multiple Availability Zones. Can a single subnet also span multiple Availability Zones?

A. Yes, to provide high availability for the resources within it.
B. No, a subnet must reside entirely within a single Availability Zone.
C. Yes, but only for the default VPC.
D. No, unless you use a special "stretched subnet" feature.

Answer: B

Explanation: This is a fundamental concept of VPC architecture. A subnet is a regional resource, but it is tied to a single, specific Availability Zone. You cannot have a subnet that spans multiple AZs. To build a multi-AZ architecture, you create separate subnets in each desired AZ.
---
Question #: 1198
You have a fleet of web servers that need to serve traffic from the internet. They are behind an Elastic Load Balancer. What is the best practice for the web server subnet?

A. Place the web servers in a public subnet to allow the ELB to route traffic to them.
B. Place the web servers in a private subnet and configure the ELB's security group to allow traffic to the web servers' security group.
C. Place the web servers in a private subnet and use a NAT Gateway to route traffic from the ELB.
D. Place the web servers in a public subnet and assign each an Elastic IP address.

Answer: B

Explanation: The best practice for a multi-tier architecture is to place your application and web servers in a private subnet, even if they serve public traffic. The public-facing Elastic Load Balancer resides in public subnets and acts as the entry point. You then configure security groups to allow traffic ONLY from the ELB to the web servers. This protects them from direct exposure to the internet.
