Question #: 88
An Aurora Global Database is being used. In the event of a regional disaster affecting the primary region, what is the procedure to fail over to the secondary region?

A. The failover is fully automatic and takes less than a minute.
B. The secondary cluster must be detached from the global database and promoted to a standalone read/write cluster.
C. A new cluster must be created in the secondary region by restoring from a snapshot.
D. The DNS CNAME must be manually updated to point to the secondary cluster.

Answer: B

Question #: 89
A developer is trying to create a Local Secondary Index (LSI) on an existing DynamoDB table. The operation is failing. Why?

A. The table already has the maximum number of LSIs.
B. LSIs can only be created when the table is first created.
C. The IAM user does not have permission to create indexes.
D. The table is in On-Demand mode.

Answer: B

Question #: 90
What is the primary difference in high-availability between ElastiCache for Redis and ElastiCache for Memcached?

A. Memcached supports Multi-AZ with automatic failover, while Redis does not.
B. Redis supports replication and Multi-AZ with automatic failover, while Memcached does not have these features natively.
C. Both services have identical high-availability features.
D. Redis is single-AZ only, while Memcached is Multi-AZ.

Answer: B

Question #: 91
An application reads the same few items from a DynamoDB table millions of times per second. This is resulting in very high provisioned RCU costs. The data can be stale for up to 5 minutes. What is the MOST cost-effective solution?

A. Use DynamoDB On-Demand capacity.
B. Place a DAX cluster in front of the DynamoDB table.
C. Use an ElastiCache cluster to cache the items.
D. Perform eventually consistent reads instead of strongly consistent reads.

Answer: B (DAX is specifically designed for this and is more integrated than a separate ElastiCache cluster).

Question #: 92
You have an RDS for MySQL instance and a Read Replica. You need to apply a security patch to the database. How should you apply the patch with minimal downtime for read operations?

A. Apply the patch to the primary first, which will cause it to reboot, then apply it to the replica.
B. Apply the patch to the Read Replica first, then promote the replica to be the new primary, and finally patch the old primary.
C. The patches are applied automatically by AWS with no downtime.
D. You must delete the Read Replica before patching the primary.

Answer: B

Question #: 93
Which feature allows you to export a point-in-time snapshot of a DynamoDB table to Amazon S3 for analytics?

B. Global Tables
C. Point-in-time recovery (PITR)
D. Export to S3

Answer: D

Question #: 94
Which Aurora feature allows you to create up to 15 low-latency read replicas that share the same underlying storage as the writer instance?

A. Aurora Global Database
B. Aurora Replicas
C. Aurora Serverless
D. Aurora Cloning

Answer: B

Question #: 95
A company wants to cache database query results. The results are complex objects. Which ElastiCache engine is better suited for storing these complex, serialized objects?

A. Redis, because it supports various data structures.
B. Memcached, because it is simpler and can be faster for basic GET/SET operations on strings/objects.
C. Both are equally suited.
D. Neither can store complex objects.

Answer: A

Question #: 96
How does a DynamoDB Query operation consume Read Capacity Units?

A. It consumes 1 RCU for every 4 KB of data returned, rounded up.
B. It is based on the number of items scanned, not the number of items returned.
C. It consumes a fixed number of RCUs per query.
D. Query operations do not consume RCUs.

Answer: A (This is true, but it's important to remember a Query can scan more items than it returns if there's a filter).

C. Replica Lag
D. A Hot Partition

Answer: C

---
Question #: 98
What is a key consideration when choosing a partition key for a DynamoDB table to ensure high performance?

A. The key should have low cardinality (few unique values).
B. The key should have high cardinality, and access patterns should be evenly distributed across its values to avoid hot spots.
C. The key should be a timestamp.
D. The key should be a sequentially increasing number.

Answer: B

Question #: 100
An application requires a cache where the most frequently accessed data is kept in memory, but the full dataset (which is larger than memory) is available. This allows for fast access to popular items while still having access to the "long tail" of data. What is this caching pattern called?

A. Write-Through
B. Lazy Loading
C. Cache-Aside
D. This is a primary function of DAX and ElastiCache, acting as a cache in front of a larger database.

Answer: D (The pattern described is the fundamental purpose of a caching layer like ElastiCache or DAX).
