Question #: 86
A DR plan has an RPO of 1 hour. A disaster strikes 45 minutes after the last successful data replication. Has the RPO been met?

A. Yes, because 45 minutes of data loss is less than the maximum acceptable 1 hour.
B. No, because some data was lost.
C. It depends on the RTO.
D. It depends on the type of data.

Answer: A

Question #: 87
What is the function of a "pilot light" in the context of the Pilot Light DR strategy?

A. It refers to the small, core pieces of the infrastructure (like the database) that are always running in the DR region.
B. It is the script that initiates the failover.
C. It is the AMI that contains the application code.
D. It is the DNS record that is changed during failover.

Answer: A

Question #: 88
A company wants to perform a DR test. They need to create an isolated environment in their DR VPC to test the failover without affecting the data replication from the primary region. What AWS feature can help with this?

A. Launching the test instances in a different, isolated subnet.
B. Taking a snapshot of the replicated DR database and restoring it to a new test instance.
C. Pausing the data replication during the test.
D. Using a different AWS account.

Question #: 91
What is a key difference between AWS Elastic Disaster Recovery (DRS) and AWS Backup?

A. DRS provides continuous, block-level replication for a low RPO, while AWS Backup is for periodic, point-in-time backups.
B. AWS Backup is more expensive than DRS.
C. DRS can only be used for on-premises servers.
D. AWS Backup provides a lower RTO than DRS.

Answer: A

Question #: 92
A company is using a Warm Standby strategy. They have a primary RDS instance and a cross-region read replica. The read replica instance size is smaller than the primary. Why is this a common practice?

A. To save costs during normal operations, with the understanding that the instance will need to be scaled up during a failover.
B. A smaller instance provides better replication performance.
C. Cross-region read replicas do not support the same instance sizes.
D. To test the application's performance on smaller hardware.

Answer: A
