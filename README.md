# Generic Quiz Platform

A fully automated, web-based quiz platform with dynamic scoring and automated quiz management. Works with any topic or subject matter.

This tool was created to address a need for a better way to identify knowledge gaps in specific training material. After finding existing solutions to be either overpriced or unsuitable, I developed this tool and am now making it publicly available.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notice

**All questions in this platform are AI-generated** and are designed specifically to help identify knowledge gaps in training material. These questions are **not intended to simulate actual exams** and should be used exclusively for educational and self-assessment purposes. The content is meant to support learning and knowledge reinforcement, not exam preparation.

## üåê Live Demo

**Try it now**: <a href="https://quiz-dyc.pages.dev" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://quiz-dyc.pages.dev</a>

> **Note**: The live demo on Cloudflare Pages runs in **read-only mode**. The quiz management features (creating/deleting quizzes) require Python server functionality and are only available when running locally. The demo includes pre-loaded sample quizzes for testing.

- **Dynamic Scoring System**: 1000-point total with 75% passing threshold

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Python Not Found
**Windows:**
- Download Python from https://python.org/downloads/
- During installation, check "Add Python to PATH"
- Restart command prompt/PowerShell

**macOS:**
```bash
# Using Homebrew (recommended)
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
brew install python

# Using pyenv
curl https://pyenv.run | bash
pyenv install 3.11.0
pyenv global 3.11.0
```

**Linux:**
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt update && sudo apt install python3

# CentOS/RHEL
sudo yum install python3

# Fedora
sudo dnf install python3
```

#### Permission Denied (macOS/Linux)
```bash
# Make scripts executable
chmod +x start_quiz.sh quick_start.sh

# Run the script
./start_quiz.sh
```

#### Port Already in Use
- Check if another instance is running
- Kill existing processes: `pkill -f final_server.py` (macOS/Linux) or `taskkill /f /im python.exe` (Windows)
- Change port in `final_server.py` if needed

#### Browser Doesn't Open Automatically
- **Windows**: Scripts use `start` command
- **macOS**: Scripts use `open` command  
- **Linux**: Scripts try `xdg-open`, then `gnome-open`
- **Manual**: Open http://localhost:8080 in any browser

#### Script Won't Execute (Windows)
- Right-click script ‚Üí "Run as administrator"
- Check if antivirus is blocking execution
- Use PowerShell instead of Command Prompt

### Platform-Specific Notes

**Windows:**
- Use PowerShell for best compatibility
- Some antivirus software may flag Python scripts
- Windows Defender may require approval for network access

**macOS:**
- Gatekeeper may block downloaded scripts initially
- Use `chmod +x` to make scripts executable
- Python 3 might be installed as `python3` command

**Linux:**
- Different distributions use different package managers
- Desktop environments vary in browser opening methods
- May need to install `python3-pip` separately
