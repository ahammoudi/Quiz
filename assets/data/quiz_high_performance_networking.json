By attaching both the Direct Connect gateway (for the on-premises connection) and the 10 VPCs to the Transit Gateway, and configuring the route tables appropriately, you create a hub-and-spoke network.

    "explanation": "The EC2 instance itself is often the source or destination of the network traffic. The instance's network performance, which is determined by its type and size and enabled by features like Enhanced Networking (ENA/EFA), is a critical factor in the overall performance of the application."

    "multiple": false,
    "explanation": "This requires configuring both \"legs\" of the connection. Setting the Viewer Protocol Policy to redirect or require HTTPS ensures the user-to-CloudFront connection is encrypted. Setting the Origin Protocol Policy to \"HTTPS Only\" ensures that the connection from CloudFront back to your origin (S3 in this case) is also encrypted."

    ],
    "multiple": false,
    "explanation": "When fronting an NLB or EC2 instance with Global Accelerator, the client IP is not preserved by default. To pass the client's IP address to your application, you must enable Proxy Protocol v2 on the NLB's target group. The NLB will then add a header to the TCP request containing the original source IP."

      "Create a Direct Connect connection to each of the 30 VPCs.",

    "multiple": false,
    "explanation": "This architecture provides a scalable and robust global network. The Transit Gateway in each region simplifies local connectivity. Inter-Region TGW Peering connects the regions. A Direct Connect Gateway acts as a global entry point, allowing you to use a single Direct Connect connection to reach resources across all three connected regions via their Transit Gateways."

You configure CloudFront to fail over to the secondary origin if the primary origin returns specific HTTP error status codes, providing resilience against origin failures."

    ],
    "multiple": false,
    "explanation": "EFA is a specialized network interface designed to accelerate inter-node communication for tightly coupled applications. Its OS-bypass capability allows applications using libraries like MPI to communicate directly with the network hardware, which dramatically reduces latency and improves the performance of large, distributed computing jobs."

    "options": [
      "Stop the EC2 instances in that region's endpoint group.",

      2
    ],
    "multiple": false,
    "explanation": "The traffic dial is a feature of Global Accelerator's endpoint groups that allows you to control the percentage of traffic that is directed to a specific region. To gracefully remove a region from service, you can simply adjust its traffic dial down to 0. Global Accelerator will stop sending any new traffic to that region and distribute it among the remaining healthy regions."

      1,
      2
    ],
    "multiple": true,
    "explanation": "After a peering connection is active, two things are required to enable traffic flow. First, the Route Tables (B) in each VPC must be updated with routes that point to the other VPC's CIDR block via the peering connection. Second, the Security Groups (C) attached to the instances must have rules that allow traffic from the source instance's IP, security group, or CIDR block on the required ports. NACLs (D) must also allow the traffic, but the default NACL allows everything, so it often doesn't need modification."

      3
    ],
    "multiple": false,
    "explanation": "This is the classic use case for Signed URLs. The company's web application, after authenticating a user, would generate a unique and temporary URL for the video file. This URL contains a policy (e.g., expiration time) and a cryptographic signature. Only users with this valid, unexpired, and correctly signed URL will be able to access the video content through CloudFront."
