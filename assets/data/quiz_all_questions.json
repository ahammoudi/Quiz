    "explanation": "Using an IAM role (via an instance profile) is the most secure method. The application automatically receives temporary, rotated credentials through the EC2 metadata service, eliminating the need to store long-term keys on the instance.

You manage one policy for the group, and permissions are automatically inherited by all users in the group. This is more scalable and less error-prone than attaching policies to individual users (A). Sharing credentials (B) is a major security risk. Creating a role for each user (D) is unnecessary overhead; groups are designed for this use case."

Resource-based policies are inline policies attached to a resource (e.g., an S3 bucket or an SQS queue) that specify which principals are allowed to perform actions on that specific resource.

In a traditional model with EC2, you pay for the instance as long as it's running, even if it's sitting idle waiting for requests.

    "options": [
      "An Application Load Balancer",
      "An EC2 instance",
      "An event bus like Amazon EventBridge or a message queue like Amazon SQS.",

    ],
    "correctAnswers": [
      2
    ],
    "multiple": false,
    "explanation": "Decoupling is a core principle of robust serverless design. Using an event bus (EventBridge) or a message queue (SQS) as an intermediary allows the producer to simply publish an event without needing to know anything about the consumers. This allows the consumer services to be scaled, updated, or even fail independently without affecting the producer."

    "multiple": false,
    "explanation": "When you place a Lambda function in a VPC, it loses its default internet access. To allow it to access public endpoints, you must provide a path to the internet. The standard, secure way to do this is to place the function's ENI in a private subnet and configure that subnet's route table to direct internet-bound traffic (0.0.0.0/0) to a NAT Gateway located in a public subnet."

    "explanation": "Lambda Layers are a mechanism for managing and sharing common dependencies. By packaging your large libraries into a layer, you can keep your function's deployment package small.

    "explanation": "While not using Multipart Upload (D) is inefficient, the actual bottleneck for a single stream is often the network bandwidth allocated to the EC2 instance itself. Different instance types have different levels of network performance. If you are on a small instance type, its maximum network throughput may be the limiting factor for your upload speed."

AWS PrivateLink (B) allows you to expose a specific service via an endpoint, which doesn't require CIDR overlap. A Transit Gateway (C) can also be used, as it performs network address translation, allowing it to connect VPCs even if their IP ranges conflict. The best solution depends on the specific use case."

    "multiple": false,
    "explanation": "When you configure an Auto Scaling group to use `ELB` health checks, it considers the instance's health to be the result of the load balancer's health check, in addition to the EC2 status checks. If the ELB reports the instance as unhealthy (e.g., because the application is not responding), the Auto Scaling group will also consider it unhealthy and will proceed to terminate and replace it."

To preserve the client's source IP address, you need to enable Proxy Protocol (version 2) on the target group. The NLB will then add a Proxy Protocol header to the TCP request, which your backend application can parse to get the original client IP."
