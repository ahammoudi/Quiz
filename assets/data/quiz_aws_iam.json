    "multiple": false,
    "explanation": "Using an IAM role (via an instance profile) is the most secure method. The application automatically receives temporary, rotated credentials through the EC2 metadata service, eliminating the need to store long-term keys on the instance. Option A and D are insecure because they involve storing static, long-term credentials on the instance. Option C is a major security violation; the root user should never be used for application access."

    "multiple": false,
    "explanation": "The \"Condition\" element is used to enforce specific circumstances for a policy. To enforce MFA, you use the condition key \"aws:MultiFactorAuthPresent\" set to \"true\" in a Deny policy or \"false\" in an Allow policy, effectively blocking actions if the user's session wasn't authenticated with MFA. Option A specifies who the policy applies to but doesn't enforce MFA. Options C and D are incorrect elements for this purpose."

    "explanation": "To assume a role, even a correctly configured one, the user or role initiating the request must have the `sts:AssumeRole` permission in its own identity-based policy. This permission must specify the ARN of the role they are trying to assume as a resource. Without this permission, the STS service will deny their request to assume the role."

    "question": "What is the purpose of an IAM group?",
    "options": [
      "To apply a set of permissions to multiple resources at once.",

    ],
    "multiple": false,
    "explanation": "An IAM group is simply a collection of IAM users. It is not an identity and cannot be used as a principal. Its sole purpose is to make it easier to manage permissions. You attach policies to the group, and all users in the group inherit those permissions."

    "question": "An S3 bucket contains sensitive data. You need to ensure that data can only be accessed from within your corporate network and from a specific EC2 role. Which type of policy is best suited for this requirement?",
    "options": [
      "An identity-based policy attached to every user.",
      "A Service Control Policy.",
      "A resource-based policy (a bucket policy).",
      "An IAM permissions boundary."

    ],
    "multiple": false,
    "explanation": "A resource-based policy (an S3 bucket policy) is the ideal place to define complex access controls for a resource. You can write a single policy that has statements to allow access to your EC2 role's ARN and also allows access based on a condition key for the source IP address (`aws:SourceIp`), all within the single policy attached directly to the bucket."

    "options": [
      "A user has successfully assumed a new role.",
      "A user has passed an IAM role to an AWS service, such as when launching an EC2 instance.",

    "correctAnswers": [
      1
    ],
    "multiple": false,
    "explanation": "The `PassRole` action is specifically for the act of granting an AWS service permission to use a role. It is a distinct permission to prevent privilege escalation. Seeing this in CloudTrail means a user authorized an AWS service (like EC2 or Lambda) to use a specific role."

    "question": "What is the key difference between authentication and authorization in the context of IAM?",
    "options": [
      "Authentication is verifying who you are; authorization is determining what you're allowed to do.",
      "Authentication is done by IAM; authorization is done by Amazon S3.",
      "Authentication uses access keys; authorization uses passwords.",
      "Authentication applies to users; authorization applies to groups."
    ],
    "correctAnswers": [
      0
    ],
    "multiple": false,
    "explanation": "This is a fundamental concept. Authentication is the process of verifying identity (e.g., checking a password or access key). Authorization is the process of checking the authenticated identity's permissions (evaluating IAM policies) to see if they are allowed to perform the requested action."

      3
    ],
    "multiple": false,
    "explanation": "`PowerUserAccess` (A) grants almost full access but explicitly denies management of IAM users and groups. To grant true administrative access, the policy must allow all actions on all resources. The correct syntax for all actions is `\"*:*\"` or simply `\"*\"`. Option D is the most accurate representation of an administrative policy."

    "question": "A company wants to allow users to sign in to the AWS Management Console using their existing Google Workspace (G Suite) credentials. What must be configured?",
    "options": [
      "An IAM role for each user in Google Workspace.",
      "A trust relationship between AWS IAM and Google as a SAML 2.0 Identity Provider.",
      "An IAM user for each person with a password matching their Google password.",

    ],
    "correctAnswers": [
      1
    ],
    "multiple": false,
    "explanation": "This is a standard identity federation scenario. You would configure Google Workspace as a SAML 2.0 Identity Provider (IdP) and configure IAM as a Service Provider (SP). This establishes a trust that allows users authenticated by Google to receive temporary credentials to access AWS by assuming a predefined IAM role."

    "correctAnswers": [
      1
    ],
    "multiple": false,

    "question": "A company wants to provide its data scientists with access to a specific S3 bucket, but only when they are connected to the corporate VPN. The VPN has a static IP address range. How can this be enforced in the S3 bucket policy?",
    "options": [
      "Use a statement with `\"Effect\": \"Allow\"` and a `Condition` checking the `aws:SourceIp` against the VPN's IP range.",
      "Use a statement with `\"Effect\": \"Deny\"` and a `Condition` checking the `s3:LocationConstraint` against the VPN's IP range.",

    ],
    "correctAnswers": [
      0
    ],
    "multiple": false,
    "explanation": "The correct way to enforce access based on IP address is to use a `Condition` element. You would create a statement that allows the desired S3 actions, and add a condition block with the `IpAddress` condition operator and the `aws:SourceIp` key, providing the VPN's CIDR block as the value. IP addresses cannot be principals (D)."

    ],
    "multiple": false,
    "explanation": "AWS CloudTrail is the service that records API activity in your account. You can search the CloudTrail event history for the `TerminateInstances` event. The event details will include the user identity (the IAM user or role) that made the call, the source IP address, the time, and the resources affected."

    "question": "What is a \"service-linked role\"?",
    "options": [
      "A role that links two AWS services together, such as Kinesis and Lambda.",
      "A role that a user creates to delegate permissions to an AWS service.",

    ],
    "multiple": false,
    "explanation": "A service-linked role (SLR) is a role that an AWS service creates in your account on your behalf when you first use a feature that requires it (e.g., AWS Auto Scaling). The role is predefined with all the permissions the service needs to manage other AWS resources for you. You can't modify its permissions, only its deletion."

    "question": "An IAM user has two policies attached. Policy 1 allows `ec2:StartInstances` on all resources. Policy 2 denies `ec2:StartInstances` on all resources, but has a `Condition` that the instance must have the tag `Stage=Prod`. What can the user do?",
    "options": [
      "The user can start any instance EXCEPT those tagged `Stage=Prod`.",
      "The user can ONLY start instances tagged `Stage=Prod`.",
      "The user cannot start any instances.",

    ],
    "correctAnswers": [
      0
    ],
    "multiple": false,
    "explanation": "The evaluation logic will process both policies. The `Allow` statement in Policy 1 permits the action. However, the `Deny` statement in Policy 2 is also checked. If the instance being started has the tag `Stage=Prod`, the condition in the deny policy is met, and the explicit deny takes precedence, blocking the action. For any instance *without* that tag, the deny condition is not met, so the deny is not applied, and the original allow from Policy 1 takes effect."
