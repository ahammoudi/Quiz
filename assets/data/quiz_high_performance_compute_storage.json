These parts can be uploaded independently and in parallel, which can significantly increase throughput by better utilizing your available network bandwidth. It also provides resiliency, as a failed part can be re-uploaded without restarting the entire object upload."

The io2 volume type is designed for high-performance workloads and can be provisioned with up to 64,000 IOPS per volume. Provisioning a 200 GiB io2 volume with the required 30,000 IOPS directly meets the requirement without over-provisioning storage.

    "explanation": "In Bursting Throughput mode, the baseline performance of an EFS file system is directly proportional to its size. Specifically, you get 50 KiB/s of baseline throughput for every 1 GiB of data stored in the EFS Standard storage class. The file system accrues burst credits when it is idle, which it can then use to burst to higher throughput levels."

    "explanation": "While S3 has high throughput, reading data over the network is always slower than reading from local storage. For repeated analysis of the same dataset, the best performance will be achieved by first copying the data from S3 to a high-performance local storage option on the EC2 instance (like an st1 EBS volume for high sequential throughput, or a local NVMe instance store). The analysis can then run against the local copy, maximizing I/O performance."

    "explanation": "For any file larger than 100 MB (and required for files > 5 GB), you should use Multipart Upload. This process breaks the file into smaller, independent parts that can be uploaded in parallel. This improves throughput by maximizing bandwidth usage and increases reliability because a failure of a single part only requires that part to be re-transmitted, not the entire file."

    "question": "What is the purpose of an S3 bucket's \"prefix\" in relation to performance?",
    "options": [
      "It encrypts the objects stored under that prefix.",
      "It defines the storage class for the objects.",
      "It acts as a partitioning key. S3 can scale to support very high request rates for each unique prefix.",
      "It is a tag used for billing purposes."
    ],
    "correctAnswers": [
      2
    ],
    "multiple": false,
    "explanation": "S3 achieves its massive scale by partitioning its index based on object prefixes. Each prefix can scale to handle thousands of requests per second. Therefore, by distributing your objects and requests across multiple prefixes, you can achieve a much higher aggregate request rate than if you stored all objects under a single prefix."

    "question": "An application requires a minimum of 400 MB/s of sequential throughput for processing large log files. The data size is 1 TB. Which EBS volume is the most cost-effective option?",
    "options": [
      "A 1 TB gp3 volume with 400 MB/s provisioned.",
      "A 1 TB st1 volume.",
      "A 1 TB io2 volume with 10,000 IOPS.",
      "A 400 GB sc1 volume."
    ],
    "correctAnswers": [
      1
    ],
    "multiple": false,
    "explanation": "The workload is for large, sequential throughput, which is the exact use case for the Throughput Optimized HDD (st1) volume type. A 1 TB st1 volume can burst to 500 MB/s and has a baseline of 40 MB/s per TB, so it easily meets the 400 MB/s requirement. It will be significantly cheaper than a gp3 or io2 volume configured for the same throughput."

    "question": "A company is running a tightly coupled molecular modeling simulation on a large cluster of EC2 instances. Which combination of features would provide the best performance?",
    "options": [
      "A spread placement group and an Application Load Balancer.",
      "A partition placement group and EFS storage.",
      "A cluster placement group and an Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA).",

    ],
    "correctAnswers": [
      2
    ],
    "multiple": false,
    "explanation": "For tightly coupled HPC workloads, you need the lowest possible latency and highest possible bandwidth between nodes. A Cluster placement group places the instances physically close together. An Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA) provides a specialized network interface that bypasses the OS kernel to provide extremely low-latency communication, which is ideal for the MPI communication patterns used in these simulations."

    "question": "Which of the following is a key characteristic of Amazon S3 storage?",
    "options": [
      "It is a block storage service.",
      "It is a file storage service.",
      "It is an object storage service with a flat namespace.",
      "It is an ephemeral storage service."
    ],
    "correctAnswers": [
      2
    ],
    "multiple": false,
    "explanation": "S3 is an object storage service. This means it stores data as objects within buckets. Each object consists of the data itself, a unique key (its name), and metadata. Unlike a file system, it has a flat structure (though the use of prefixes in keys can simulate a hierarchy)."

    "question": "An EC2 instance is performing poorly. CloudWatch metrics show 100% CPU utilization and a high `DiskReadOps` metric for its EBS volume. What is the most likely bottleneck?",
    "options": [
      "The instance is network-bound.",
      "The instance is CPU-bound and potentially I/O-bound.",
      "The EBS volume is configured with too much throughput.",
      "The instance is memory-bound."
    ],
    "correctAnswers": [
      1
    ],
    "multiple": false,
    "explanation": "100% CPU utilization clearly indicates that the instance is CPU-bound; it does not have enough processing power for its workload. A high `DiskReadOps` (IOPS) metric suggests that it is also heavily using its storage. This combination means the instance is likely bottlenecked on both CPU and I/O, and a larger instance type or a volume with higher IOPS may be needed."

    "question": "When is it appropriate to use an EFS file system in \"Max I/O\" performance mode?",
    "options": [
      "For a latency-sensitive web content management system.",
      "For a large-scale, parallel data processing job that needs to maximize aggregate throughput.",
      "When you need to provision a specific level of throughput.",
      "When cost is the most important factor."
    ],
    "correctAnswers": [
      1
    ],
    "multiple": false,
    "explanation": "Max I/O mode is designed for applications that are highly parallel and need to achieve the highest possible aggregate throughput and IOPS from the file system. It trades a small amount of metadata latency for this increased scale, making it ideal for big data analytics, media processing, and large-scale simulations."

    "correctAnswers": [
      2
    ],
    "multiple": false,
    "explanation": "For io1 and io2 volumes, there is a maximum ratio of IOPS to size that you can provision. For io2 volumes, this ratio is 1,000 IOPS per GiB. This means, for example, a 10 GiB io2 volume can be provisioned with a maximum of 10,000 IOPS."

    "question": "A web application serves a large amount of static content (images, CSS, JavaScript) from an EFS file system mounted across a fleet of EC2 web servers. Users are reporting slow page load times. What is the BEST way to improve the performance for a global user base?",
    "options": [
      "Switch the EFS performance mode to Max I/O.",
      "Increase the size of the EC2 instances.",

    ],
    "correctAnswers": [
      2
    ],
    "multiple": false,
    "explanation": "The best way to improve performance for delivering static content to a global audience is to use a Content Delivery Network (CDN) like Amazon CloudFront. CloudFront will cache the static assets at its numerous edge locations around the world. When a user requests an asset, it will be served from a nearby edge location instead of making a long trip back to your EFS file system, dramatically reducing latency and improving performance."
