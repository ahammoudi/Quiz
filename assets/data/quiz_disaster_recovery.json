By keeping a scaled-down but fully functional version of the application running in the DR region, the time to recover (RTO) is significantly reduced because you only need to scale up the running resources, not provision them from scratch. This can easily be achieved in under an hour. More frequent backups (C) would improve the RPO but not the RTO. Multi-Site (A) would be overkill and more expensive."

    "explanation": "RTO is about the speed of recovery. The most significant factor in reducing recovery time is automation. By using infrastructure as code (IaC) with a tool like CloudFormation, you can stand up your entire application stack in the DR region in minutes, a process that could take many hours or days to do manually. More frequent snapshots (A) improve RPO. Storing backups in Glacier (C) would dramatically increase your RTO."

    "question": "For a \"Warm Standby\" DR strategy, why is the environment in the DR region \"scaled-down\"?",
    "options": [
      "To improve performance.",
      "To make it easier to test.",
      "To save costs by running fewer or smaller instances than the full production load requires.",
      "To comply with software licensing restrictions."
    ],
    "correctAnswers": [
      2
    ],
    "multiple": false,
    "explanation": "The primary motivation for running a scaled-down version of the environment is cost optimization. A Warm Standby provides a much faster RTO than a Pilot Light, but running a full-scale replica can be expensive. By keeping a smaller but fully functional version running, you balance the need for a fast recovery with the desire to keep DR costs down."

    "question": "Your DR strategy uses a failover CNAME record in Route 53 that points to your load balancer. What is a prerequisite for this configuration?",
    "options": [
      "The load balancer must have a static IP address.",
      "The CNAME record must have a very high TTL.",
      "You cannot create a CNAME record for the zone apex (e.g., `example.com`).",
      "The load balancer must be a Network Load Balancer."
    ],
    "correctAnswers": [
      2
    ],
    "multiple": false,
    "explanation": "A CNAME (Canonical Name) record maps an alias name to a true or canonical domain name. A fundamental rule of DNS is that if you have a CNAME record for a hostname, you cannot have any other DNS records for that same hostname. Since the zone apex (the \"naked\" domain) must have certain records like SOA and NS records, you cannot create a CNAME for it. This is why you must use an \"A\" Alias record in Route 53 to point a zone apex to a load balancer."

    "question": "What does \"failback\" mean in the context of disaster recovery?",
    "options": [
      "The process of failing a second time after a recovery.",
      "The process of restoring service to the original, primary region after it has been repaired.",
      "The process of backing up the DR site.",
      "The process of failing over to a third region."
    ],
    "correctAnswers": [
      1
    ],
    "multiple": false,
    "explanation": "Failback is the process of returning production traffic to the original primary site after it has been declared healthy and ready to resume operations. This is often a planned and carefully managed process to ensure a smooth transition back from the DR site."

    "question": "Which of the following data stores is a multi-region, multi-master database by default, making it ideal for active-active DR?",
    "options": [
      "Amazon RDS for MySQL",
      "Amazon Redshift",
      "Amazon DynamoDB with Global Tables",
      "Amazon ElastiCache for Redis"
    ],
    "correctAnswers": [
      2
    ],
    "multiple": false,
    "explanation": "DynamoDB with Global Tables is designed from the ground up to be a multi-region, active-active database. You can write to any regional replica, and the changes are automatically propagated to the other regions. This makes it a perfect fit for global applications requiring extremely low RTO and RPO."

    "question": "A key principle of disaster recovery planning is to avoid having a single point of failure. Which AWS concept is a direct implementation of this principle for high availability?",
    "options": [
      "Using a single, large EC2 instance.",
      "Storing all data on a single EBS volume.",
      "Deploying resources across multiple Availability Zones.",
      "Using a single IAM user with administrator access."
    ],
    "correctAnswers": [
      2
    ],
    "multiple": false,
    "explanation": "An Availability Zone is a distinct, physically isolated data center. By designing your application to run across multiple AZs, you ensure that the failure of any single data center will not take down your entire application. This is the most fundamental way to avoid a single point of failure for infrastructure within an AWS region."

    "question": "Your DR plan is based on Pilot Light. Data is replicated, and the CloudFormation template is ready. What is the single most important factor that will determine your Recovery Time Objective (RTO)?",
    "options": [
      "The RPO of your data replication.",
      "The speed at which you can launch and bootstrap your application servers.",
      "The TTL of your DNS records.",
      "The number of users trying to access the application."
    ],
    "correctAnswers": [
      1
    ],
    "multiple": false,
    "explanation": "In a Pilot Light scenario, the data is already present. The failover process is dominated by the time it takes to execute the \"lighting the pilot\" phase: launching the EC2 instances from the template, waiting for them to boot, running any bootstrap scripts, and having them become healthy and ready to serve traffic. The speed and reliability of this process is the main component of your RTO."
