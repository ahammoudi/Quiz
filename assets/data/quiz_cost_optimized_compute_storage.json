    "multiple": false,
    "explanation": "Standard Reserved Instances offer the highest discount (up to 72%) in exchange for a commitment to a specific instance family, size, and region for a 1 or 3-year term. Since the workload is predictable and uses a specific instance family, this provides the best cost savings. On-Demand (A) is flexible but most expensive. Spot (B) is for interruptible workloads. Convertible RIs (D) offer a lower discount in exchange for flexibility to change instance families."

S3 Glacier Deep Archive (D) is even cheaper but has a default retrieval time of 12 hours, which meets the requirement, however, Flexible Retrieval also offers expedited retrievals in minutes, making it more flexible. Given the requirement is *within* 12 hours, Flexible Retrieval is a safe and cost-effective choice. S3 Standard (A) and IA (B) are too expensive for 7-year archival."

    "explanation": "An EC2 Instance Savings Plan offers a higher discount than a Compute Savings Plan. The trade-off is less flexibility; it only applies to a specific instance family in a specific region. Since the company's usage is confined to exactly that (m5 in us-east-1), the EC2 Instance Savings Plan will give them the best possible discount for a savings plan model."

    "options": [
      "It compresses all objects to reduce their size.",
      "It automatically moves objects between frequent and infrequent access tiers based on monitoring access patterns.",

    ],
    "correctAnswers": [
      1
    ],
    "multiple": false,
    "explanation": "S3 Intelligent-Tiering saves you money by automating the tiering process. Instead of you having to guess which objects are infrequently accessed and creating a lifecycle policy, the storage class itself monitors the objects. If an object is not accessed for 30 consecutive days, it is moved to a lower-cost tier automatically, saving you money without any manual effort or performance impact on access."

The RI utilization report shows you what percentage of your purchased RI hours were used, helping you identify any waste. The RI coverage report shows what percentage of your total instance usage was covered by reservations."

    "multiple": false,
    "explanation": "Retrieving data from the Glacier tiers involves multiple cost components. There is a small fee for each restore request you make. The main cost is the per-gigabyte fee for the amount of data you are restoring. Finally, if you are transferring the data out to the internet, standard S3 data transfer out fees would also apply."

The primary trigger for the action is then the age of the object."

A \"Rebalance Recommendation\" is an early signal that an instance is at an elevated risk of being interrupted. An \"Interruption Notice\" is the final, two-minute warning that the instance will be reclaimed. Your application can be designed to listen for these signals and proactively start moving work off the instance before it is terminated."

    "explanation": "An EC2 Instance Savings Plan offers a higher discount than a Compute Savings Plan. The trade-off is that it is less flexible. If your workload is very stable and you are certain you will continue using a specific instance family in a specific region, the EC2 Instance Savings Plan will provide greater savings because you are making a more specific commitment."
